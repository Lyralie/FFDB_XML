<pb n="95"/>A long time ago the moon fell down from the sky. As there was no longer a moon the nights were very dark. One day Bongso was out hunting with his dog. He came to Klau Kecil River near Mount Pallas.<note>The Chewong used to live at the headwater of the Klau Kecil River, which is on Mount Pallas in Central Pahang. When the Chinese made plantations on Mount Pallas, they withdrew to the area around Mount Benom, to the Krau River area.</note> His eyes lit upon a beautiful woman down in the water. Bongso's dog ran up towards her, but before he reached the woman, the dog fell down dead. He had shown disrespect, tolah<note>See "Taʼ Tatrahoi." Again the moon is singled out as particularly vulnerable to tolah.</note>. Bongso looked at the woman. "Oh, don't be frightened. I am the moon," said she. "I fell down from the sky and I cannot get back up again. Can you help me?" "I could, but I am frightened of tolah," replied Bongso. "No, no, don't be frightened," insisted the moon. "But I am. My dog died when he went close to you," said Bongso. "No, truly you need not be frightened. No harm will come to you" the moon told him, "I want to go home, but I have been in this river for three days unable to move out of it." When he heard this Bongso went up to the moon and pulled her out.

After some the time the moon gave birth to a child. This was Bongso's child. One of the stars is the child of the moon and Bongso.
