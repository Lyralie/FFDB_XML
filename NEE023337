A long time ago the moon fell down from the sky. As there was no longer a moon the nights were very dark. One day <persName>Bongso</persName> was out hunting with his <animal>dog</animal>. He came to <placeName>Klau Kecil River</placeName> near <placeName>Mount Pallas</placeName>.<note>The Chewong used to live at the headwater of the <placeName>Klau Kecil River</placeName>, which is on <placeName>Mount Pallas</placeName> in <placeName>Central Pahang</placeName>. When the Chinese made plantations on <placeName>Mount Pallas</placeName>, they withdrew to the area around <placeName>Mount Benom</placeName>, to the <placeName>Krau River</placeName> area.</note> His eyes lit upon a beautiful woman down in the water. <persName>Bongso</persName>'s <animal>dog</animal> ran up towards her, but before he reached the woman, the <animal>dog</animal> fell down dead. He had shown disrespect, <ref target="g:GEE2143.048">tolah</ref><note>See "Taʼ Tatrahoi." Again the moon is singled out as particularly vulnerable to <ref target="g:GEE2143.048">tolah</ref>.</note>. <persName>Bongso</persName> looked at the woman. "Oh, don't be frightened. I am the moon," said she. "I fell down from the sky and I cannot get back up again. Can you help me?" "I could, but I am frightened of <ref target="g:GEE2143.048">tolah</ref>," replied <persName>Bongso</persName>. "No, no, don't be frightened," insisted the moon. "But I am. My <animal>dog</animal> died when he went close to you," said <persName>Bongso</persName>. "No, truly you need not be frightened. No harm will come to you" the moon told him, "I want to go home, but I have been in this river for three days unable to move out of it." When he heard this <persName>Bongso</persName> went up to the moon and pulled her out. The moon gave <persName>Bongso</persName> a tobacco pouch<note>A tobacco pouch is one of the gifts that a young girl is expected to give her husband-to-be.</note>, and they slept together. The next day <persName>Bongso</persName> returned to his own settlement. The people there were very upset because the moon had vanished from the sky and there was total darkness at night. "No, she has not vanished, she has fallen in the river," <persName>Bongso</persName> told them, "she wants help to return to the sky, so she asked all of us if we want to help her. The people said that they would help to get the moon back to the sky, they missed not seeing her at night. So they prepared to <ref target="g:GEE2143.025">nöpoh</ref>. They collected and made head bands, <ref target="g:GEE2143.035">riding</ref>, and a <ref target="g:GEE2143.036">ruwai</ref> string, (tali <ref target="g:GEE2143.036">ruwai</ref>). They all played the <plant>bamboo</plant> drums. <persName>Bongso</persName> did the singing. The <ref target="g:GEE2143.036">ruwai</ref> string became a path to the sky and the moon climbed up it. The next night they saw her back in her usual place,
After some the time the moon gave birth to a child. This was <persName>Bongso</persName>'s child. <epimyth>One of the stars is the child of the moon and <persName>Bongso</persName>.</epimyth>
