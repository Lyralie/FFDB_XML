Animals were born of a woman. Once a number of people were travelling together, among them a husband and wife, the latter in the eighth month of her pregnancy. As she could not keep up with the other people, they left her and her husband behind. At last she could not travel farther, and told her husband, "You had better leave me and hunt game. Come back in a few days and bring me meat." Her husband then left her, and joined the people. In about a month's time he came back. 
Meanwhile his wife had given birth to a child. When he came near <pb n="231"/>her lodge, he saw many animals, and heard many kinds of noise. The animals were all young, and were running around in the lodge playing. Without talking to his wife, he went back and told the people, for he was a little afraid. They would not believe what he told them, so some of them returned with him to see. When they came near, they saw all kinds of animals running about in the lodge and playing, just as he had seen them. They now believed, and went back and told the other people.  The woman had given birth to all kinds of animals. The first-born was a mouse, and therefore mice are now very small. The next-born was a chipmunk, and thus each child born was larger than the preceding. The last-born was the moose, and therefore he is very large. 
Now the woman made a great blanket, like a huge moose-skin, and stretched it flat over the country. She tied one corner to Level Mountain,<note>A long mountain-ridge or plateau north of Telegraph Creek, Stikine River.</note> one corner to Dease Mountain,<note>A mountain near Dease Lake.</note> one corner to Tsᴇxtcaʼz Mountain,<note>A mountain in the Tlepan district, south of Stikine River.</note> and one corner to Atixzaʼ Mountain.<note>A mountain on the south side of Stikine River, also known as Glacier and Sand Mountain.</note> She then called all her children, and told them to jump on the blanket one by one and run around. The blanket was springy, and moved up and down. Moose ran only a short distance when he was thrown off. Caribou ran much farther before bouncing off. Only Mountain-Sheep was able to run all round the blanket without being thrown off. Therefore the sheep is now the best runner of all the animals. He never tires and never falls down, and he can go in steep places anywhere. Having learned how each of her children could run, the woman now scattered her children over the country, assigning to each the locality best suited for him as habitat. The sheep and goat, being the surest-footed, were put in the most difficult country. 
Then she told each one of her children what he should eat. She told Moose that he should browse on willows, and Caribou that he should eat moss. Now the woman, having finished her task, travelled north and disappeared. She never returned to the people. She lives in the far north; and when people see the aurora, they say, "Atsᴇntmāʼ is throwing fire [or burning sticks] out of her house." Her name Atsᴇntmāʼ, which means 'meat-mother.'<note>Also 'game-mother.'</note> She still controls movements of her children, the animals, here on earth.
