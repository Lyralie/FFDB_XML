A [certain] rich man of Kotankeś. even when taking a walk, had a sword by his side. Now there lived people in Nituj [and] in Tojukusi [at that time]. Between these [villages] there went people in the night, going to visit the people of Kotankeś. Behind [them] went a devil bearing a fire. One [devil] bore the name of "devil with birch-bark torch", [which] carrying, [he] walked behind people. The light of the fire upon the snow was like the day. The name of him: "devil with birch-bark torch", - lo, such it is. These people were afraid, [and] coming to Kotankeś <pb n="77"/>told it; to the rich man of Kotankeś [they] told. This rich man, taking the sword at his side, came to the Noteto. When he came to the Noteto, behind him was a noise [as] of a man [who steps]. Turning [saw] Birch-bark-Torch coming after. 
[He] bore his hidden sword, having drawn [it and] carrying the sword with one hand under his armpit, [and] thrusting [back]-wards, setting out the end of the reversed sword, when behind [him] approached the noise of footsteps close ... close ... all but touching [him] ... then [he] lunged with the sword: [the devil] writhed [to and fro]. When [he] had seen that, he also [became as] dead, but revived a little after. Leaving [his sword he] went [back] to Kotankeś [and] told of it: "When [I] thrust with the sword at Birch-bark-Torch. I also [was as] dead there, when [I] thrust [and] let go [my] sword [from my hand], [I] left it [and] came [away]; to-morrow when you rise [go and] see". 
When the next day the servants came to see [there] was a dead raven with the sword in its side. Birch-bark-Torch, after being killed [by] the man, apparently had done [thus] with himself [and] transformed himself into a raven. <pb n="78"/>Therefore the people made an inau at the Noteto. In that place of the inau the people now living, established hereditarily, live there in order to make the inau. 
Therefore the people henceforth called the rich man of Kotankeś the devil-killer. This rich man went [one day] in the spring guestwise to Taraika. Sitting [in] a [sledge drawn by] good dogs, [he] went driving up to the earth-houses in Taraika, [but] all the people had removed: [there] was not human breath [there]. Nevertheless [he] entered [one] empty earth-house. [He] collected some rubbish, kindled a fire; the light of the fire was [visible]; he, sitting next the door near to the oven, kindled a fire. 
When [he] looked, to the right of the oven [there] was a big old man, also kindling a fire; in one corner of the hearth [he] made the fire, [and] upon the fire he put some rubbish. The rich man of Kotankeś smoked, the Empty-House-Devil also smoked tobacco; [he] knocked [some ashes] out [of his] pipe, Empty-House-Devil also knocked [some ashes] out [of his] pipe; [he] knocked all [the ashes] out [of his] pipe, <pb n="79"/>that also did the Empty-House-Devil imitate. [He] pulled out [his] sword [and] struck his sheath with it. Empty-House-Devil also pulled out [his] sword [and] struck [his] sheath with it. Whatever he did, [it] was quite impossible [to prevent the goblin from imitating]. 
Therefore he thought that it would be a little better, if he went outside and took a jump. Therefore [he went and] jumped. When [he] went outside [it was clearly to be seen that] the principal thong of the harness had been cut; [and the two dogs] the leading dog and the second dog were standing near the door. When [he] went out [they] entered the house; [after] was a noise [as] of the Empty-House-Devil cutting at the dogs. There was a cry of pain from the dogs. On having heard this, [he] seated himself on the sledge and drove away. 
He drove down to the Taraika summer huts [and] told about this. When the next day the people of [that] earth-house went to see these two dogs, the leading dog had evidently been cut [to pieces]: the head [and] the forepart of the trunk had evidently bounded off to the right near the pillar by the back wall from one side of it on to the heaped earth flanging the wall. The back part of the body had evidently bounded off to the pillar [which was] under the airhole, [and] above the heaped earth, flanging the wall. 
<pb n="80"/>So sharp it seemed was the sword of Empty-House-Devil. [Yes!] At last the people found [it]: when [it] had cut [that] one dog [to pieces], its head had rolled down to the bottom of the firewood pile; [and] the back part of the body was on the right side of the house, the side near the door, upon the heaped earth flanging the wall. The Ainus have seen [that, and] coming down told of it: thus was [this] thing.
