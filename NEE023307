A long time ago <persName>Tohan</persName> had a knife. He forgot it in the jungle and did not return to look for it. The knife cried bitterly. A passing <animal>tiger</animal> heard the crying and went up to the knife. "Why are you crying?" he asked. "<persName>Tohan</persName> has forgotten all about me," replied the knife, "you go and bite him." In those days <animal>tigers</animal> did not know about biting people. "No, I don't know how", said the <animal>tiger</animal>. "You bite him here," said the knife pointing to the <animal>tiger</animal>'s throat. So the <animal>tiger</animal> went to <persName>Tohan</persName> and bit him in the throat. <persName>Tohan</persName> died. <epimyth>Since that time <animal>tigers</animal> have been biting humans.</epimyth><note>This legend provides a reason for why <animal>tigers</animal> prey on humans which differs from the previous legend. Although it is not stated that the above is an example of <ref target="g:GEE2143.030">punén</ref>, it is likely that this myth is related to one kind of <ref target="g:GEE2143.030">punén</ref>, namely that if one has lost one's knife in the jungle it is <ref target="g:GEE2143.030">punén</ref> not to go in search of it. Transgression of this kind of <ref target="g:GEE2143.030">punén</ref> leads to attack by a <animal>tiger</animal>. (See Part IV).</note>
