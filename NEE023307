<pb n="11"/>A long time ago Tohan had a knife. He forgot it in the jungle and did not return to look for it. The knife cried bitterly. A passing tiger heard the crying and went up to the knife. "Why are you crying?" he asked. "Tohan has forgotten all about me," replied the knife, "you go and bite him." In those days tigers did not know about biting people. "No, I don't know how", said the tiger. "You bite him here," said the knife pointing to the tiger's throat. So the tiger went to Tohan and bit him in the throat. Tohan died. Since that time tigers have been biting humans.<note>This legend provides a reason for why tigers prey on humans which differs from the previous legend. Although it is not stated that the above is an example of <ref target="g:GEE2143.030">punén</ref>, it is likely that this myth is related to one kind of <ref target="g:GEE2143.030">punén</ref>, namely that if one has lost one's knife in the jungle it is <ref target="g:GEE2143.030">punén</ref> not to go in search of it. Transgression of this kind of <ref target="g:GEE2143.030">punén</ref> leads to attack by a tiger. (See Part IV).</note>
