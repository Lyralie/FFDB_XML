Then Young-Seal [Sleeping-Eye-Woman] invited [the myth people to a feast]. Young-Seal washed her hands, <pb n="239"/>and she warmed her hands. Then fat dripped out of them into a dish, and that dish was filled. Then she placed it before her guests, and her tribe ate. They went out. Then it was Ōʼᵋmāł's [turn]. "Invite, invite, invite, invite for this Ōʼᵋmāł!" said Canoe-Calking. The myth people entered. Then Ōʼᵋmāł washed his hands, and warmed them by the fire. Ōʼᵋmāł's hands just shrivelled up. Then he was trampled upon, and his tribe went out. 
Then "Invite, invite, invite for this Kingfisher-made-to-go-up." The myth people entered, and she speared spring-salmon. Then she steamed the spring-salmon on stones. Then Ōʼᵋmāł arose, and he sent for his bird-head mask and his dancing-apron to be brought. "Go on, sing for me, that I may dance!" said Ōʼᵋmāł. "Go into the floor, go into the floor, Ōʼᵋmāł! Go into the floor, Ōʼᵋmāł!" Then his feet sank into the ground. Go into the floor, go into the floor, Ōʼᵋmāł! Go into the floor, Ōʼᵋmāł!" Then his body sank, and only his head was on the floor. "Go into the floor, go into the floor, Ōʼᵋmāł! Go into the floor, Ōʼᵋmāł!" Then his head sank, and only his bird-head mask stood on the floor. "Go into the floor, go into the floor, Ōʼᵋmāł!" Then his bird-head mask sank, and he staid for a long time below. Then he made [the myth people] impatient. "Our elder brother has fooled us many times with what he cooks," said his tribe. Then they looked into the steaming-hole. What should there be! Behold! the bird-headdress was there. He had gone to what had been cooking. Then he was trampled upon by his tribe, and they went out. Invite, invite, invite for this Ōʼᵋmāł!" They entered. Then he speared a salmon. He fell into the water, and he was just pulled ashore by his younger brothers when he was drifting down the river on his back. 
"Invite, invite, invite for this Squirrel-made-to-go-up!" <pb n="241"/>They entered. Then Ōʼᵋmāł was lazy. They tried to call him again. "What is the matter with him?" said Ōʼᵋmāł. "Maybe you who called us have only gum eyes." Then Ōʼᵋmāł was told, "Squirrel-made-to-go-up invites to a great feast." Thus Ōʼᵋmāł was told. "What is it?" said Ōʼᵋmāł. "It is [?]." Then Ōʼᵋmāł sent for Canoe-Calking. "Lead this Ōʼᵋmāł!" Thus said Canoe-Calking. Nobody answered him. "I don't receive an answer," said Canoe-Calking. Then he said, "Ts!ᴇʼnts!ᴇnqaʟaxs." He stood up at the end of the fireplace, and Ts!ᴇʼnts!ᴇnqaʟaxs said, "Lead Ōʼᵋmāł!" Thus said Ts!ᴇʼnts!ᴇnqaʟaxs. Nobody answered him. Then Squirrel- made-to-go-up spoke. "Let this ugly one come and put his mouth to this knot-hole." Thus said Squirrel-made-to-go-up. Then Ōʼᵋmāł started, and went to put his mouth to the knot-hole. Then red-hot stones were taken up with tongs. They were wrapped around with [?] and put into Ōʼᵋmāł's mouth. "Qwā, qwā, qwā, qwāx!" said Ōʼᵋmāł. His mouth was burned.
