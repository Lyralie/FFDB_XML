<ref target="g:GIP0247.001">Bahloo</ref> the moon looked down at the earth one night, when his light was shining quite <color>brightly</color>, to see if any one was moving. When the earth people were all asleep was the time he chose for playing with his three <animal>dogs</animal>. He called them <animal>dogs</animal>, but the earth people called them <animal>snakes</animal>, the <animal>death adder</animal>, the <animal><color>black</color> snake</animal>, and the <animal>tiger snake</animal>. As he looked down on to the earth, with his three <animal>dogs</animal> beside him, <ref target="g:GIP0247.001">Bahloo</ref> saw about a dozen <ref target="g:GIP0247.040">daens</ref>, or <color>black</color> fellows, crossing a creek. He called to them saying, "Stop, I want you to carry my <animal>dogs</animal> across that creek." But the <color>black</color> fellows, though they liked <ref target="g:GIP0247.001">Bahloo</ref> well, did not like his <animal>dogs</animal>, for sometimes when he had brought these <animal>dogs</animal> to play on the earth, they had bitten not only the earth <animal>dogs</animal> but their masters; and the poison left by the bites had killed those bitten. So the <color>black</color> fellows said, "No, <ref target="g:GIP0247.001">Bahloo</ref>, we are too frightened; your <animal>dogs</animal> might bite us. They are not like our <animal>dogs</animal>, whose bite would not kill us."
<ref target="g:GIP0247.001">Bahloo</ref> said, "If you do what I ask you, when you die you shall come to life again, not die and stay always where you are put when you are dead. See this piece of bark. <pb n="9"/>I throw it into the water." And he threw a piece of bark into the creek. "See it comes to the top again and floats. That is what would happen to you if you would do what I ask you: first under when you die, then up again at once. If you will not take my <animal>dogs</animal> over, you foolish <ref target="g:GIP0247.040">daens</ref>, you will die like this," and he threw a stone into the creek, which sank to the bottom. "You will be like that stone, never rise again, <ref target="g:GIP0247.130">Wombah</ref> <ref target="g:GIP0247.040">daens</ref>!"
But the <color>black</color> fellows said, "We cannot do it, <ref target="g:GIP0247.001">Bahloo</ref>. We are too frightened of your <animal>dogs</animal>."
"I will come down and carry them over myself to show you that they are quite safe and harmless." And down he came, the <animal><color>black</color> snake</animal> coiled round one arm, the <animal>tiger snake</animal> round the other, and the <animal>death adder</animal> on his shoulder, coiled towards his neck. He carried them over. When he had crossed the creek he picked up a big stone, and he threw it into the water, saying, "Now, you cowardly <ref target="g:GIP0247.040">daens</ref>, you would not do what I, <ref target="g:GIP0247.001">Bahloo</ref>, asked you to do, and so forever you have lost the chance of rising again after you die. You will just stay where you are put, like that stone does under the water, and grow, as it does, to be part of the earth. If you had done what I asked you, you could have died as often as I die, and have come to life as often as I come to life. But now you will only be <color>black</color> fellows while you live, and bones when you are dead."
<ref target="g:GIP0247.001">Bahloo</ref> looked so cross, and the three <animal>snakes</animal> hissed so fiercely, that the <color>black</color> fellows were very glad to see them disappear from their sight behind the <plant>trees</plant>. The <color>black</color> fellows had always been frightened of <ref target="g:GIP0247.001">Bahloo</ref>'s <animal>dogs</animal>, and now they hated them, and they said, "If we could get <pb n="10"/>them away from <ref target="g:GIP0247.001">Bahloo</ref> we would kill them." And thenceforth, whenever they saw a <animal>snake</animal> alone they killed it. But <ref target="g:GIP0247.001">Bahloo</ref> only sent more, for he said, "As long as there are <color>black</color> fellows there shall be <animal>snakes</animal> to remind them that they would not do what I asked them."
