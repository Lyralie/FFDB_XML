<pb n="59"/>There was once a man who lived with his aunt (baha). The aunt had one child, a very beautiful girl. The man was ugly, but he wanted to marry his cousin. One day the girl went to the river to throw away the stomach and intestines of a deer that had been killed. They had eaten the bajo of a deer which her mother's husband had killed that day. The "real" person of the deer had gone back home<note>Here that aspect of a person which continues to live after death is described as the real person. The body is shed, and the "ghost", yinlugen, comes into existence. When the Chewong say, "We only eat the bajo of an animal, the real person goes home," they mean to an afterworld. Each species of conscious being has its own separate afterworld. However, there was some inconsistency regarding whether this world is only for yinlugen only or whether those animals who "are people", i.e. have consciousness, can also go there whenever they wish to get away from daily life. See the legend "Bongso and the elephants."</note>. While the girl was by the river, the ghost (yinlugen) of the deer arrived. He took the girl and brought her to the land of the deer. Their land is in the jungle. 
In the evening the people conducted a <ref target="g:GEE2143.025">nöpoh</ref> to try and find the girl. The man attempted to send his <ref target="g:GEE2143.036">ruwai</ref> in search of her, but he could not see her anywhere. He was not a <ref target="g:GEE2143.032">putao</ref>. The next day they found a stone which the girl had worn around her neck. It was by the river. They tied it to a string of rattan, and the girl's mother wore it in the evening. She missed her daughter very much. All the people conducted another <ref target="g:GEE2143.025">nöpoh</ref>, but nobody could find her. 
The next day Bongso [the man's younger brother] arrived. He was <ref target="g:GEE2143.032">putao</ref> and he knew what to do. He made a pair of antlers out of wood. These he put on and went to the land of the deer. The people did not do a <ref target="g:GEE2143.025">nöpoh</ref>, there was no need. Bongso was a very great <ref target="g:GEE2143.032">putao</ref>, and it presented no difficulty for him to send his <ref target="g:GEE2143.036">ruwai</ref> in search of the girl<note>The really great <ref target="g:GEE2143.032">putao</ref> are said to be able to send their <ref target="g:GEE2143.036">ruwai</ref> out without the aid of ritual paraphenalia or a <ref target="g:GEE2143.025">nöpoh</ref></note>. When he arrived at the land of the deer, he took the girl away from the deer which had abducted her. The deer thought that Bongso was a deer as well, so he did not mind him taking the girl. Bongso brought the girl back to her mother, and they were married the following day. The older brother was angry for he wished to marry the girl himself, but the aunt did not want to give her daughter to him. She gave her to Bongso who had tricked the deer ghost.
