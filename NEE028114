I was a wealthy man. Being a wealthy man in Rurupa, I heard that in another village there was a beautiful young girl who was reared for me. One day, I wanted to go [to her], and went. I suspended my bone-inlaid pipe-holder to my girdle, and set out. Going, not having [yet] arrived at the village, <pb n="173"/>I saw the footmarks of a man who had gone [before]. When I looked at those footmarks, [I saw] they were just like [those of] my feet. 
The marks of the man that walked were [thus, and] I followed [them]. Going, I arrived at the other village. From the house the young girl came out, [and] looked at me, from my feet raising [her eyes] to my head; then she looked, casting down [her eyes] to my feet, and went in [to the house]. When she had entered the house, she said softly: "Into the yard there has come a wealthy man like the wealthy man who came before - the wealthy man who has come now is quite like [him]. [His] bone-inlaid pipe-holder is just the same". The master of the house said: "Two men like [one another] have come on the same day. Which man shall I have for son-in-law? I know not". 
He ordered the man to be brought [to him]. When this young girl came out, and when she brought me in, I went in [with her]. Having come in, I looked round: before me sat a wealthy man. When I looked, [I saw] him [to be] quite <pb n="174"/>like myself. I went near and sat down. I greeted the master of the house. When [I] had done, they prepared [food], a hard roe and [edible] sea-weed. They ate. 
When [they] had done, the master of the house said: "Today two men have come. I know not indeed to whom I shall give my young girl. Various things shall be done in order to find out. Play some game, whereby I may know. Quick, play!". 
In order to play, the wealthy man who had come later, stretched out his hands over the frame that surrounded the fire-place. The man who came first struck the hands of the man who came after; it hurt very much, almost to death. In anger, he made the man who came first stretch out his hands, and in his turn he struck him. He struck his fingers, benumbing [them]. And this man died; either slept [swooning] or died. 
When it came to [be] late [in the] evening, he moved his legs a little, and little by little raised himself. With almost dead eyes [he] gazed at him, and said: "The man of Rurupa! <pb n="175"/>I thought thou wast a man; and I also am a god of the sea. This man of Rurupa hath dealt thus finely by me, who am the mightiest of all gods. Though I am a god, almost hast thou sent me to the Under-World. 
Since I myself am guilty, I will give thee a divine [gift]". As he spoke, from his bosom [he drew] a beautiful sword-guard: on one side of that guard was placed a number of gods, on the other side of the guard a similar [as it were] twin [sculpture] was placed. From this sword-guard fire [or flame] as it were came forth. 
This beautiful sword-guard did he give to me, I took [it]. Having taken [it], saluted, giving thanks. Afterwards, that [over-]man went out into the yard, and went away to the sea-shore. When I saw that, I [too] went out. I looked, and the god entered the water of the sea. 
As I was guilty, having done harm to the 'Killer', god [of the sea], I going out with an 'inau' [on the sea-shore], gave [it unto him]. I returned to the house; and at last the <pb n="176"/>master of the house said: "I thought that the man who had come first was the man to whom I had given my daughter; nevertheless, I did not know that he was a god. Now I know that the man who came after, the wealthy man of Rurupa, [is he for whom] [have] I brought up my daughter". This little girl did I take. 
To my village with her did I go; [and] we were finally married. A son, - one son, - a daughter - one daughter, I had. Afterwards I related to my son this goodly tale [how], when I was young, and wanted to marry, when I went forth to marry, I was more artful than a god; to my son told I [this]". Thereafter they died [the man and his wife].
