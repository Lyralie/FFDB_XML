The origin tradition of the Tahltan, giving the origin of the tribe and phratries, the migrations of the people, and the origins of the clans, was collected. It is similar to that collected by Emmons,<note>Ibid., 14-20.</note> but fuller. The Indians look on these traditions as historical rather than mythological and it is intended to incorporate them in the forthcoming memoir on the general ethnology of the Tahltan. None of the incidents in the tradition or traditions are of a mythological character, or of value for comparison with mythological tales of other tribes.
