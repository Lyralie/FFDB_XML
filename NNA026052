Raven went to the house of Bear-Man, who was wealthy. Bear invited him in, saying, "I do not have a very fine house, or much clothes and goods, but I have plenty of food, and will give you something to eat." He placed all kinds of food in great plenty before Raven, who ate and ate, until at last he was quite full. When leaving, Raven invited Bear to visit him, and two days afterwards he went. Raven had just finished building a <pb n="221"/>large, fine, new house; but he had no food, and the house qas quite empty. Bear, who was well dressed and wore a big hat, sat down outside. Raven invited him in. Bear saw it was indeed a fine house, but he saw no food or anything inside. Raven called Willow-Grouse to bring a dish and put it down before the fire, but Bear saw no person and no dish.<note>Some informants think Raven simply pretended he had Willow-Grouse as a servant, and a dish for grease, to fool Bear or to show off. Others incline to think he really had an invisible helper and an invisible dish, and possibly an invisible fire. Some say Bear heard sounds as if some one brought a dish and placed it at the fire. Compare Traditions of the Tsʹetsʹāʹut, No. 8, p. 265, with which there seems to be a slight analogy. - J. A. TEIT.</note> 
Raven then got up in front of the fire and held his hands out, as if to let grease drip into a dish; but, instead of grease coming, he burned his hands. For this reason there are no feathers on Raven's feet now, and they look as if they had been scorched. Bear said,: "There is no necessity to do that. I do not like to see you burn your hands. You had better stop. If you have no food to give to me, I will return home and eat." Since that time people sometimes have had no food in their homes, because Raven had none in his when Bear visited him.
