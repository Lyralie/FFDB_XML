The ǃ′õǃ′õ bird found some honey one day, and was chopping it out of the tree. ǁgauwa heard his axe ringing. He heard the sounds of chopping, and he followed them. The ringing of the axe led him right to where ǃ′õǃ′õ was. ǁgauwa sat down to watch how he was chopping out the honey. He said to himself, "Won't I get some of this honey to eat?" He looked at all the honey ǃ′õǃ′õ had chopped down. Then he asked for some of it to eat. "Won't you give me a little of your honey?" But ǃ′õǃ′õ refused. "This honey is mine," he said, "this is my honey. And I′m not going to give you any." So ǁgauwa just sat and watched him chop. He chopped until he was finished, and then he took out all the honey. He packed it up and got up and left.
Later ǁgauwa went to ǃ′õǃ′õ′s house and stole all that honey. ǃ′õǃ′õ didn′t have a bit of honey left. ǁgauwa took it all and went off and ate it. ǃ′õǃ′õ fought with him over it, but ǁgauwa had eaten it all. The ǃ′õǃ′õ went away empty-handed. That's what ǃ′õǃ′õ and ǁaiha did, ǃ′õǃ′õ and Kauha. That's the story of these two and the honey. God took the honey away from ǃ′õǃ′õ. And ǃ′õǃ′õ, the owner of the honey, got none of it to eat and had to go away with nothing. They fought and fought, Kauha took the honey and ǃ′õǃ′õ went off empty-handed.
