A long time ago there was a huge <plant>tree</plant> growing near the ocean. Lots and lots of jungle people were trying to cut it down. Four thousand people were cutting at it. Finally it fell, and it became the <placeName>Pahang River</placeName> which was a very large river and the water flooded the banks. When they saw this the people wanted to return to <placeName>Krau</placeName>. On the way they had to cross the <placeName>Pahang River</placeName> upstream. The <ref target="g:GEE2143.033">raja</ref> of all the jungle people was carrying their books. As he was crossing the river, the books fell in and disappeared. <epimyth>Since that day the jungle people have no longer been able to read and write.</epimyth>
