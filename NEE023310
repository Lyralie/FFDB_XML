<pb n="8"/>A long time ago there was a huge tree growing near the ocean. Lots and lots of jungle people were trying to cut it down. Four thousand people were cutting at it. Finally it fell, and it became the Pahang River which was a very large river and the water flooded the banks. When they saw this the people wanted to return to Krau. On the way they had to cross the Pahang River The raja of all the jungle people was carrying their books. As he was crossing the river, the books fell in and disappeared. Since that day the jungle people have no longer been able to read and write.
