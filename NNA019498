She was asleep. Then he lifted her blanket and put the excrements behind Virgin. "Oh!" said Ō'ᵋmāł to Virgin, "don't sleep!" Thus said Ō'ᵋmāł to Virgin. "You have made a mess. Let me swallow some of your water," said Ō'ᵋmāł. "You may do so," said Virgin. Then he drank. He had not swallowed much water. Then he was taken by the nape of the neck by Virgin. He put ashes into his mouth [and said,] "I did not drink any, look at the grayness of my tongue!" Behold! he had put ashes into his mouth. "Let me tell about the mess you made," said Ō'ᵋmāł. Then go on and drink!" Then he drank. She stopped him again. "You have had enough." Thus was said to Ō'ᵋmāł by Virgin. Again he put something on his tongue. "Look at the grayness of my tongue! I have not swallowed any of your water." Thus said Ō'ᵋmāł. "Let me tell about the mess you made," said Ō'ᵋmāł. "Then go <pb n="227"/>on and drink!" He drank. He drank all the water of Virgin. Then Virgin became a bluejay, when she had no more water. Ō'ᵋmāł began to fly all around our world, making water. That is how all our people obtained water.
