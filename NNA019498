She was asleep. Then he lifted her blanket and put the excrements behind Virgin. "Oh!" said Ōʹᵋmāł to Virgin, "don't sleep!" Thus said Ōʹᵋmāł to Virgin. "You have made a mess. Let me swallow some of your water," said Ōʹᵋmāł. "You may do so," said Virgin. Then he drank. He had not swallowed much water. Then he was taken by the nape of the neck by Virgin. He put ashes into his mouth [and said,] "I did not drink any, look at the grayness of my tongue!" Behold! he had put ashes into his mouth. "Let me tell about the mess you made," said Ōʹᵋmāł. Then go on and drink!" Then he drank. She stopped him again. "You have had enough." Thus was said to Ōʹᵋmāł by Virgin. Again he put something on his tongue. "Look at the grayness of my tongue! I have not swallowed any of your water." Thus said Ōʹᵋmāł. "Let me tell about the mess you made," said Ōʹᵋmāł. "Then go <pb n="227"/>on and drink!" He drank. He drank all the water of Virgin. Then Virgin became a bluejay, when she had no more water. Ōʹᵋmāł began to fly all around our world, making water. That is how all our people obtained water.
