A man who had married a girl, the daughter of a man of evil disposition, was hated by his father-in-law, who had made up his mind to kill him. One day he told the man to go hunting at a place where a gigantic cannibal toad lived. When the man approached the toad's abode, he knew by the power of his protectors that he was in danger, and called on them for assistance. His four protectors - the grizzly bear, black bear, wolf, and lynx - appeared at once. The toad came out to fight the man, and opened its great mouth to bite him. Grizzly Bear, who was foremost, immediately jumped down its throat before it could bring its jaws together, and the others followed him. Then the four tore its entrails, and the man shot and killed it. The animals ate their way out, leaving four great holes in his body.<note>Compare Eʼdestā or Big-Toad Stories (JAFL 32 : 221).

The following day he asked him to go hunting on a high mountain at a place where snow-slides always came down and killed people. When he reached this place, he changed himself into something<note>The narrator did not remember what the thing was. Compare RBAE 31 : 803.</note> so tiny that the snow-slide could not crush it. The avalanche came and carried him down, but failed to harm him. When he arrived at the bottom, he resumed his natural form and went home. His father-in-law could hardly suppress his disappointment and anger. 
He said to his daughter, "I will change you into a grizzly bear. Go out on yonder side-hill and act and feed like a bear." He put bear-skin on her, and told her to tear her husband. Then he pointed out the bear to his son-in-law, who went to kill it. When he came <pb n="236"/>near and was about to shoot, his wife called out, "Don't shoot! Save me! I am your wife." He never heeded, and kept on shooting until he had killed her. His father-in-law was now very angry, and pursued him. The man threw down part of the inside of the bear;<note>"The Magic Flight:" Assiniboin (Lowie, PaAM 4 : 177), Bellabella (Boas, Sagen, 240), Bellacoola (Boas, Sagen, 268), Blackfoot (Wissler, PaAM 2 : 70), Cheyenne (Kroe-ber, JAFL 13 : 184), Chinook (Boas, BBAE 20 : 78), Kwakiutl (Boas, Sagen, 164), Menominee (Skinner, PaAM 13 : 365 [526], 372 [526]), Micmac (Rand, 165), Nootka (Boas, Sagen, 99), Osage (Dorsey, FM 7 : 23), Pawnee (Dorsey, CI 59 : 31), Quinault (Farrand, JE 2 : 114), Rivers Inlet (Boas, Sagen, 224), San Carlos Apache (Goddard, PaAM 24 : 84), Northern Saulteaux (Skinner, PaAM 9 : 88), Tsʼᴇtsʼaut (Boas, JAFL 9 : 260).

The latter caught up again; and the man threw something behind him, which again formed an obstacle and delayed his pursuer. Thus he threw down several things, which became canyons, lakes, etc., behind him. His father-in-law managed to pass them all, and again caught up. He had only one thing left that he could throw. This was a stick,<note>Some people say it was a fire-drill or fire-rock.</note> which turned into fire. His pursuer ran right into the fire, and was burned to death.
