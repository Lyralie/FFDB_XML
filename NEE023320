<pb n="61"/>Taʼ Kae<note>Taʼ means 'grandfather', but it is often prefixed to someone's nickname. Kae is another Chewong word for keo, the flying lemur which according to the Chewong is keòi See the legend "Taʼ Tatrahòi" in Part III B.</note> - who was really a bas keòi<note>Keòi is a type of bas. They appear in the form of flying lemurs, but often put on human <ref target="g:GEE2143.004">bajo</ref> in order to trick their victims. They are interested in eating blood which they always lick with great relish. They also eat intestines and the half digested content of the stomach.</note> - came one day to a settlement in the jungle. There was only one house and it belonged to a couple who had two daughters. Taʼ Kae moved in and married the oldest daughter. But he would not have sexual intercourse with his wife because he was frightened of tika<note>Tika is the rule that proscribes the mixing of specified foods. For instance most types of meat must be eaten separately. Here sexual intercourse is likened to the act of eating, so what is forbidden is the performing of two different activities on the same "meat". This remark in the story always provoked howls of laughter from the audience. Taʼ Kae also fears tika when he will not eat monkey meat immediately before he plans to eat human meat. The result of tika is always a fatal attack by bas</note> since he intended to eat her later. They slept on separate mats at either end of the house. The next day Taʼ Kae told his wife that they would go on a hunting expedition and spend a few nights in the jungle. They set off, and on the way they crossed two rivers. Taʼ Kae built a lean-to on the ground and then he went hunting. He shot a leaf monkey. This he took back to his wife. She cooked it, but Taʼ Kae did not want to eat any of it. He only ate some <plant><ref target="g:GEE2143.040">takkad</ref></plant> roots that he had dug up. In the night they slept separately again, the wife inside the lean-to and Taʼ Kae on the ground. He did not want tika. Next morning he went hunting again. He shot another monkey which he put in his backbasket and set off for home. On the way he took a narogn leaf, which is full of lice, and put this on his head. He walked with the leaf on his head, and only threw it away when he was close to the lean-to. He gave the monkey to his wife, and she wanted to start preparing it straight away. "No, do that later," said her husband, "I have so many lice. You must try to catch some". "I'll do that afterwards. I want to eat," replied the wife. "No, come and have a look now," insisted Taʼ Kae. Meanwhile he was sharpening his knife. He said that it was in order to squash the lice that she found. The wife went over and started picking the lice from his hair. "Oh, one has gone on to your throat," said Taʼ Kae, "look up and I will catch it." The wife bent her head back. "Further, further," said Taʼ Kae, and when his wife had bent her head right back, he took his knife and cut her throat. He drank her blood and ate her stomach contents. 
The next day, after having another big meal of his wife's body, Taʼ Kae returned to his parents-in-law's house. When he got close he started to cry and wail. "Your child has died," he sobbed. "What!" exclaimed his father-in-law. "Your child has died," repeated Taʼ Kae, "her knife slipped." So Taʼ Kae married the younger daughter. But again he would not have sexual intercourse with her, and they slept separately. In the night he complained about being cold, and his wife asked him to join her, but this he refused to do.
<pb n="62"/>After a few days Taʼ Kae told his new wife that he was going hunting and that he would like her to accompany him. As they walked, his wife kept asking him "Is this where my sister went? Is this the river which my sister crossed?" and so on, all along the route. Taʼ Kae told her that they were taking exactly the same route. They came to the same clearing where Taʼ Kae had built a lean-to on the previous occasion. He told his wife to wait while he went hunting. He shot a leaf monkey and put it in his basket, and she dug up some <plant><ref target="g:GEE2143.040">takkad</ref></plant> roots, which was all Taʼ Kae wanted to eat. In the night the wife slept in the lean-to and Taʼ Kae on the ground outside. "Come and sleep with me," his wife called out, but he refused. He did not want tika. 
The next morning Taʼ Kae set out hunting, shot a monkey, put it in his basket and on the way back put some narogn leaves on his head. Meanwhile, the wife had found the bones of her sister which Taʼ Kae had thrown aside. She understood what had happened and ran away, back to her parents. When Taʼ Kae came back to the lean-to and could find his wife nowhere, he thought she had gone to look for wild tubers, so he waited for her. As she did not return, he went to sleep and thought that perhaps she had been attacked by a tiger. The next morning he set off back to his parents-in-law, and when he came close their house he began to cry and wail, "Your child has died, she has been taken by a tiger," he sobbed. But his wife had returned home and told her parents what had happened: that Taʼ Kae had killed and eaten her sister. When her father heard that, he knew that his son-in-law was really a keòi so when he came back crying, the father-in-law stabbed him in the chest with his spear, and then placed him inside the house and set fire to it.<note>We find in all the myths that the only way to destroy a harmful superhuman being is to use either fire or boiling water, two substances which are, in daily life, the agents of transformation.</note>
