ǃgãunũ,<note>"My (paternal) grandfather, ǀχúgẹn-ddí, was the one who told me star's stories."</note> he was formerly a great Star; therefore, his name is ǃgãunũ; while he feels that he was the one who formerly spoke [lit. "called"] the Stars' names; while he feels that he is a great one. Therefore, he called the Stars' names. Therefore, the Stars possess their names; while they feel that ǃgãunũ was the one who called their names. He formerly sang, while he uttered the Stars' names. He said "ǁχwhāī"<note>The stars ǁχwhāī ǀāīti and ǁχwhāī-ʘpụă were identified as "Altair" or "Alpha Aquilae", and "Gamma Aquilae", respectively, by the late Mr. George Maclear and Mr. Finlay of the Royal Observatory, on October 10, 1873, at Mowbray. ǁχwhāī gwāī was behind a tree and too low to be distinguished.</note> to [some] Stars which are very small; they are those of which he made ǁχwhāī; their small, fine ones are those which are ǁχwhāī. <pb n="81"/>Therefore, the porcupine, when these Stars have, sitting, turned back, he will not remain on the hunting ground; for, he knows that it is dawn, when ǁχwhāī has, lying, turned back. He returns home; for, he is used to look at these Stars; they are those which he watches; while he feels that he knows that the dawn's Stars they are.
