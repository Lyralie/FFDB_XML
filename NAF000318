<persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName>'s mother was living with her daughter and her daughter's husband in the bush, and the husband was having luck in hunting. One day he killed a <animal>duiker</animal>. It was raining, and he killed a <animal>duiker</animal>. He left the camp that they had together, and went off and killed it. In the morning it was raining, and he went out and killed the <animal>duiker</animal>.
When he came back with the meat, <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> said to him, "Since you have been killing all these <animal>duikers</animal>, aren't we about ready to go back to join the rest of our people? Isn't that what we agreed to do?"
But her husband answered, "No, I don't want to return to them yet. I want to keep on hunting these <animal>duikers</animal> so I will have plenty of meat to give your mother. I want to hunt for your mother's people and come home with plenty."
"All right," said <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName>. "You are certainly talking sense. You will hunt some more and kill <animal>animals</animal> and soften their skins. My mother will have meat to eat, and when you have softened the skins, you can sew her an apron from them."
When they had agreed upon this plan, the husband went hunting again. Well, what should happen, what should happen, but that he should kill another <animal>duiker</animal>! He set out in the morning, and he chased the <animal>duiker</animal> and chased it and chased it until finally he killed it. Now at that time the <plant>tshõ</plant> had come up and was ripe and pretty. It was mature, and its bulbs were swollen and ready to be eaten. The <animal>duiker</animal> led the husband a chase across the <plant>tshõ</plant> patches far off in the <plant>bush</plant>. When he went back to the camp he said to his little daughter, "Yesterday when I was following a <animal>duiker</animal>, I saw a patch of <plant>tshõ</plant> bulbs, all ripe and ready to be gathered. Why don't you and your grandmother go and pick them?"
"Yes!" said the little girl, "that's just what we'll do. Mother can stay home and granny and I will go to pick <plant>tshõ</plant>." So the old woman and her granddaughter set out. They walked and walked until they came to where the child's father had been chasing the <animal>duiker</animal>.
When they got there, the bulbs were ripe and round as a man's balls. The child saw them first. She cried, "Here we are! Is this the place my father meant? Granny, come dig up these nice <plant>tshõ</plant> bulbs." When the grandmother saw them, she exclaimed, "ǁhwoi - ǁhwoi - s-a – ka - ǁhwoi, hwi – hwi-s - a-ka-hwi! Was it here your father chased the <animal>duiker</animal> yesterday, so that his balls have fallen upon the ground?"
"Yo!" cried the child. "What are you saying, granny? Are you saying that where my father yesterday … are you insulting my father? Are you insulting my father and saying that his balls are lying on the ground here?"
"What do you mean, child? Stop talking such foulness! What do you think you're doing talking like that? Don't you know what you're talking about, don't you see that he's my son-in-law and I fear him and respect him? Knowing that, how can you talk like this?"
So the child said only, "Grannie, come dig up these bulbs we were talking about. Come dig up these bulbs." So the old woman went to her and dug up the <plant>tshõ</plant>. She dug them and dug them and then she looked at what she had dug up. "O!" she cried. "ǁhwoi - ǁhwoi - s - a - ka - ǁhwoi, hwi - hwi - s - a - ka - hwi! Yesterday my son-in-law was chasing a <animal>duiker</animal> here and his balls have fallen on the ground! Hee-hee! This is how his balls look! This is what the tops of his balls look like!"
"Granny!" cried the child again. "Are you insulting my father?"
"Stop talking like that!" answered the old woman. "Are you saying I don't have respect for other people? Quit this kind of talking - what's got into you today?" So they dug and dug, and then they started home.
On the way the little girl said, "I've gotten very hungry. Let's go home and you can roast the <plant>tshõ</plant> so I'll have something to eat."
"All right," answered her grandmother. "You can go on into camp while I collect some firewood." They walked and walked. As they neared the camp, the old woman picked up pieces of firewood and put them in her kaross. She gathered wood until she had a load.
The little girl went on ahead. When she came into the camp she saw a dead <animal>duiker</animal>. There was her father; he had already killed a <animal>duiker</animal> and returned to camp to skin it. The little girl ran up to him. "Father! Granny and I went out together and she insulted you to death! She 'killed' you! She said that a certain place was where you had been chasing a <animal>duiker</animal>, and that your balls were lying together on the ground."
"Yo! What on earth! What can you be saying! What kind of talk is this?" exclaimed her father. But he went on skinning the <animal>duiker</animal>. He skinned it and opened it up and took out its intestines and hung them from a tree. Then he took out its stomach and dumped out its contents. Then he filled the stomach with the <animal>duiker</animal>'s blood and hung that in a tree. All right now, I want you to take the intestines and give them to your grandmother. She'll cook them and both of you can eat. "
"What? She's insulted you to death and you want me to take her the <animal>duiker</animal>'s intestines?"
"Uru - u - u! What's wrong with you, child? Don't you know there's such a thing as respect for other people? What do you mean, saying your own grandmother has insulted someone?"
But the child said, "I just won't do it. If she hadn't insulted you I would have taken her the <animal>duiker</animal> intestines, but she insulted you to death."
"Oh, alright, I'll take them to her," said her father. He took the intestines down from the tree. Then he took a kaross and wrapped it around himself. He picked up his axe, a Goba [Bantu] axe that was big and sharp and hid it inside the kaross in an inside pocket. Then he went across to his mother-in-law's fire. "Here, take the <animal>duiker</animal> intestines. I've brought them to you myself, because your grandchild refused to." He took out the intestines and gave them to her. Then he said, "Why do some people insult other people?" The old woman craned her neck and looked up into her son-in-law's face. Her neck was exposed as he stood above her. "Dzop!" He chopped her head off with the axe. The blood spurted from her: it was simply horrible.
<persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> was not there to see her mother die; since early morning she had been off gathering somewhere else. So her husband was able to arrange the body in secret. He dragged it out of the pool of blood. He took its arms and pulled it into a hut. There he covered up all signs of foul play. But since the bones of the corpse's neck were broken, there was no stopping the flow of blood. He went away, but the blood kept on dripping.
<persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName>'s husband went back to his own fire; he hung the <animal>duiker</animal>'s intestines by his mother-in-law's hut and went back to sit by his own fire. All this while, <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> was off in the <plant>bush</bush> eating and gathering. She ate <animal>lizards</animal>, <animal>mice</animal>, <animal>dung beetles</animal>, all sorts of inedible things. She ate some and gathered some. She collected them and stowed them in her kaross to take home. Then she gathered a load of firewood and put that in her kaross, and at last she headed back to the camp.
Her child and her husband were sitting by their fire when she arrived. Her husband was cooking the <animal>duiker</animal>. <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> glanced toward her mother's hut. Her mother appeared to be lying inside asleep. "Yo!" said <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName>. "What's wrong with mother? Why has she come home and gone straight to bed? Why doesn't she blow on her fire and cook something so she'll have something to eat? All she'll have to do is sit up and roast it. Why should she have to sleep on an empty stomach?" So she divided into piles the food she had brought, <animal>dung beetles</animal>, the <animal>mice</animal>, the <animal>lizards</animal> and all the other things. Then she said to her little daughter, "Go give these to your grandmother so she can sit up and blow on her fire and roast herself something to eat. Why is she still lying down?"
But the child answered, "No, I won't."
"You won't?" said <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName>. "What do you mean, you won't?" As she said this, <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> knew in her heart what had happened. Her heart told her that the child had related the insult to her father. Her heart told her that her husband had killed his mother-in-law and covered her body. Her heart told her this was why the child refused to take the food to the old woman's hut. So she walked across the camp. She could see the flow of blood where it had gushed out. "Yes, I knew it," she said to herself. "I already knew it. My child has told on her grandmother, and this is what happened. Well, I won't let him know that I know. I'll just set down the food I've brought and go back to my own fire."
So she left her mother's hut and went back to her own. She heaped wood on her fire, and it began to smoke. The wind blew the smoke first one way and then the other. <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> changed her sitting place each time the wind changed, so that she could sit in the smoke and cry unobserved. Her face was covered with tears. Her husband said, "Yo! What are you crying about?"
"Uru!" she answered loudly. "Why on earth should I be crying? Why do you think I'm crying when it's only the smoke in my eyes? This fire is awful - it just keeps smoking in my eyes. I don't have anything to cry about. Can't you see this fire just keeps smoking in my eyes so that they keep on watering?" Everytime her husband would ask her why she was crying, she would say it was only the smoke in her face.
Finally, it grew <color>dark</color> and they went to bed. The husband lay down right away, but <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> remained sitting up in her blanket and nibbling on the food she had brought. Her husband dropped off to sleep, but she sat on into the night thinking. She thought about the insult her child had carried between her mother and her husband. She thought about the murder that had resulted. "Oho! Just you wait!" she whispered to her sleeping husband. "I'm going to get you! You killed my mother and so I'm going to kill you." <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> turned these thoughts over in her mind. "Kuru!" she said to herself. "If I take a spear from this pile of short spears he has and try to kill him with it, will I manage to stay alive myself?" She thought the matter over. Then she pulled out a spear from the pile. But as she did, the spearheads rattled against each other. Their rattling woke her husband.
"Yo! What are you doing rattling spears together?"
"Yo!" she retorted. "What would I be doing with spears? These spears you hear are my brothers' spears: they are on the move tonight. Why do you think I'd want to have anything to do with spears?"
In this way she meant to soothe his fear so that his watchfulness would no longer hinder her plans. "Just wait!" she said to herself, "as soon as he's off his guard, I'll kill him." But he stayed awake, and she had no chance of reaching for a spear a second time. Then a fresh thought struck her. "There's no point in his going on living when I'm wearing a knife. That's what I'll use to kill him." Then she slowly and carefully drew out her knife and lay it in the fire. It lay there and grew hot. It heated up until it was <color>red</color>-hot. Then <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> did to her husband the same thing he had done to her mother. Yes, she killed him. When his body lay still, she went to sleep.
In the morning, she gathered up her mother's blood into a ball and stuck it in the left side of her groin. Then she gathered up her husband's blood and stuck it in the right side of her groin. She dumped her husband's body in the <plant>bush</plant>. Then she came back and fetched her mother's body and dumped it in the <plant>bush</plant> as well.
When she returned, she found a group of people sitting with her children in the camp. They were eating together. Her husband's younger brothers had arrived while she was busy in the <plant>bush</plant>. "What have my brothers-in-law come for?" she wondered. "What are they going to do to me?" Just then her little son ran across to one of the men. "Uncle, Uncle!" <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> knew that he was going to say, "Mother has killed my father! Now you know." So she grabbed the little boy and turned his attention to something else.
Then the brothers were ready to leave. They told <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> to pack up her things, that she was coming with them. So she packed up all kinds of <plant>thorns</plants> - <plant>morningstar thorns</plant>, <plant>ǁgamiǁgami thorns</plant>, everything, and was ready to go. But she did it so quickly that she was ready before they were. Thus she fled the camp and ran off in the direction of her own people's camp, where her mother's people, her father's people, her older brothers, and all their children were living.
Meanwhile, <animal>vultures</animal> had begun to gather in the sky. The husband's younger brothers said to themselves, "what are these <animal>vultures</animal> after? What on earth can be making them all gather together like this? Ooh! Just look at them flapping their wings." The <animal>vultures</animal> began to drop out of the sky. They came down on the body of <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName>'s husband, and they came down on the body of her mother. The brothers ran to where they came down and found them feasting upon the bodies. "Kuru!" they cried. "Is this what she's done? Here's what that child was trying to tell us about her mother - that she had killed her father! But he didn't manage to get the story told. Now we'll have to leave the child's father and come back to bury him later."
Now that they knew what had happened, they lost no time in getting out to pursue <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName>. They tracked her and tracked her, and soon had begun to catch up with her. But her child gave her some help: <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> said to the child, "My brothers-in-law are following us. Won't you help me watch out behind for them; won't you look for them and tell me when you see them? Otherwise, they are going to come up on us and kill us." Then <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> began to strew <plant>morningstar thorns</plant> in the path behind her as she fled. When the brothers came as far as that place, they ran into the midst of the thorns. The <plant>thorns</plant> stuck into their feet and pierced their feet - it was just terrible for them. They stumbled around looking for a way out of the thorns. Meanwhile, <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> and her child ran on ahead, far into the distance. The brothers' feet were pierced over and over again by the <plant>thorns</plant>. Finally, they managed to extricate themselves. They made a wide circle around the <plant>thorns</plant> and began to follow <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName>'s trail again.
Now <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName>'s daughter was a little <animal>guinea</animal> <animal>fowl</animal>. She was watching to the rear for her mother. She saw the brothers catching up again, so she cried, "Kasasa-aa-ǀwe - ǀwe!" ["They're almost upon us!"] "ǀwe - ǀwe!" she cried. "What shall I do, what ever shall I do? I'm about to die, with nobody to help me!" said <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName>. Then she scattered her big <plant>ǁgamiǁgami [devil's claw] thorns</plant> that had very long spines. When the brothers came to where the <plant>thorns</plant> were, they ran right in among them. The <plant>thorns</plant> were so big that they broke the brothers' shoes to pieces.
<persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> and her daughter ran on. The sun beat down upon them. They struggled to keep running. Now, a single cloud hung in the sky. <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> spoke to it, saying "Why is it that I'm about to die and you're not helping me at all? Don't you see what's happening, don't you see that I'm going to die?" Well, the cloud did help her. It waited until her brothers-in-law had stopped at their camp for the night. When they were inside their houses with their children, the cloud sent down a rain so hard it nearly killed them all. In the morning they came shivering out of their houses to build fires to warm themselves by, and again the cloud dropped a drenching downpour upon them. All they could do was to stand around and shiver.
Then do you know what those young men did? They said, "Why doesn't our grandfather send us after her again? Come on, let's go! Why should <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> remain alive when she has killed our brother? Let's be sure to get her this time. When someone so important as an older brother gets killed, someone else will die for it later." So the brothers left their camp and walked until they came to the waterhole. They planned to kill her there. They sat down in the <plant>bushes</plant> near the waterhole and waited for her to come. While they were waiting there, some other people came down to the waterhole to fetch water. They saw the brothers and hurried back to <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> with the news.
"Your brothers-in-law have come after you. They have already come to kill you. Be warned."
"Yes," she answered, "do you think I don't know? Of course I know already ... I know they're there." To her grandmother she said, "When I leave here, granny, do you know what I want you to do for me? Well, something is going to fly to you from the direction of that waterhole. It will fly to you and perch at the top of your spine. That something will be my heart's blood. Now when that happens, you must hurry and put it in a pouch. (ǁoka nǃa laughs.) Yes, I want you to put it into a pouch for me."
Then <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> went down to the waterhole. The brothers put a <animal>dipper</animal> into the water-hole and brought up, not water, but mud for her to drink. "Yo!" she said. "If you're going to kill me, at least give me good water to drink so my blood will flow clean. What do you think you're doing?" So the brothers dipped up good water for her to drink. Then they took out their knives and stabbed her.
Her heart's blood sprang from the top of her spine and flew to fling itself - "ǂdedi!" squarely at the middle of the top of her grandmother's spine. The grandmother hastened to take hold of it and put it into a pouch. Once inside the pouch it began to grow. It grew and grew and grew until it was a grown person again. But still it lived in the bag in secret.
Now one day all the women in the camp, except the grandmother, had gone gathering. When they were returning they heard the sound of <plant>nǂhn</plant> being pounded into powder in the camp. "Hey, everybody," they said, "who's pounding <plant>nǂhn</plant>? Who can that be pounding <plant>nǂhn</plant> in our camp? We're almost there: let's hurry and see who it is." When they came into the camp, they cried, "Ooo! Where has such a beautiful woman come from? Why, it's our older sister, our aunt, our what-have-you - greetings to our relative! Here's our relative returned to us again!" And they greeted her and embraced her happily, and she lived quietly with them for some time.
But one day her husband's younger brothers made a new plan. "Let's marry her this time - come on!" they said to each other. "Let's not talk any more about killing her, because she's so very beautiful. Such a person you don't kill, you marry her instead."
But one of the brothers disagreed. "Yo! She's beautiful, but was our older brother ugly? He was beautiful too, and she killed him: why do you say we shouldn't kill her but should marry her instead?"
The brothers argued back and forth. "Let's marry her!" "No: let's kill her!" they shouted to each other. But finally they decided to marry her. So they all left their camp and went to get her. There were many of them, and they brought her home with them to their camp.
When they arrived at the camp, she took out her medicine horn, the kind that kills people. Then she blew: "Nǃaaaaa! What do you think you're doing, yo? First you kill me and now you think you're going to marry me? What kind of marriage did you have in mind? If this is what you're going to do, I'll see that all of you die! Not a one of you shall have me."
<epilogue>And that's just what happened. With her magical horn, <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> flattened them all. Every one of the brothers died. They were finished, dead, and did not come back to life again. <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> went home to her own camp. Now you've seen what things were like in the long-ago time.</epilogue>
