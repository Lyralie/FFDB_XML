Once two lads killed their step-father and then ran away. Their mother became distracted at the loss of her husband, and chased them, intending to kill them. She became possessed of extraordinary powers of speed, and soon drew near her sons, who were travelling on snow-shoes and carrying caribou-meat. They threw some caribou-hair behind them, which at once became transformed into an immense herd of caribou that dotted the plateau so thickly, that their mother could not pass through them. She then transformed herself into something very small, and rolled through. Again she drew near; and the lads threw the contents of a caribou-stomach behind them, which changed into a boggy, mossy country full of thick brush. She surmounted this and came near again. They threw the stomach or tripe <pb n="241"/>of the caribou behind them, and it became transformed into a piece of country with deep gulches, canyons, and valleys. Again she came near; and they threw some caribou-bones behind them, which became transformed into a tract of very rough, rocky ground. Still she pursued them. They threw some meat of caribou behind them, which changed into marshy ground and lakes. Finally, they threw their fire-stones behind them. They changed into fire. Their mother ran into it and was burned up. Had it not been for these men throwing the parts of the caribou behind them, the country would now be level instead of rough with mountains, valleys, gulches, rocks, and brush, as it is now.
