The ancestor of the ʟēʹʟgēd was Q!ēʹx·ʟala. He came into existence at Tsᴇdāʹsas in Hardy Bay, when the world was first lighted. He wore a very large head-ring, so that it had to be supported on each side. As a shaman his name was Haiʹalik·ilał. His son was Hëʹlik·ilig·imis, whose son was Hēʹx·ak·inîs. His son was Awāʹlasᴇlał, whose son was Tsᴇxᵋwīʹd. He died recently.
