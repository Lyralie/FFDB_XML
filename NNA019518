The ancestor of the ʟē′ʟgēd was Q!ē′x·ʟala. He came into existence at Tsᴇdā′sas in Hardy Bay, when the world was first lighted. He wore a very large head-ring, so that it had to be supported on each side. As a shaman his name was Hai′alik·ilał. His son was Hë′lik·ilig·imis, whose son was Hē′x·ak·inîs. His son was Awā′lasᴇlał, whose son was Tsᴇxᵋwī′d. He died recently.
