The ancestor of the ʟēʼʟgēd was Q!ēʼx·ʟala. He came into existence at Tsᴇdāʼsas in Hardy Bay, when the world was first lighted. He wore a very large head-ring, so that it had to be supported on each side. As a shaman his name was Haiʼalik·ilał. His son was Hëʼlik·ilig·imis, whose son was Hēʼx·ak·inîs. His son was Awāʼlasᴇlał, whose son was Tsᴇxᵋwīʼd. He died recently.
