<note>This myth was told me by the Western Chewong. The term moskin was not known by the Eastern Chewong. It is another name for the bi asal of Earth Six.</note>
<pb n="121"/>Once there was a moskin who lived on Earth Six. One day as she was washing her plate it fell down to Earth Seven. The girl followed after it. She came to a mountain. Here she crossed over a deep cavity in the ground which was the home of a snake. As she leapt across, the snake swallowed her. The snake moved and encircled the mountain. The girl was inside the snake's stomach for a long time, but one day when it defecated she came out. She was dead by this time, but she became alive again by the wind. She clapped her hands and turned into a large bumble bee. She flew towards Bongso's house. When Bongso heard the buzz of the bumble-bee he wanted to swat it. "If you hit me, I die," said the girl to him. Bongso did not hit her and she became human again. The girl and Bongso slept together. Bongso wanted to visit his mother's house. He went alone, leaving his new wife on her own in their house. While he was gone, an old man came to the house. When he saw the girl, he said, "I want that girl for a wife." "No, I have a husband already," replied she. She did not want an old man for husband. In the evening she ran away. She ran to Bongso's mother house. She told Bongso that she did not want to go on living on Earth Seven, so the two of them returned to her house on Earth Six.
