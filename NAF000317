The two brothers made a plan. "Today is the day," said the younger, "that we will go kill our sister-in-law. This woman our older brother married - today we're going to kill her."
They walked and walked and came to the waterhole. They sat down by the water. Their sister-in-law's people were already camped nearby. The two brothers waited for her by the waterhole. One brother said, "someone's coming, someone's coming, who is it, is it she?" But the other scorned him. "No, silly. When this woman comes there will be no mistaking her. You'll hear her ornaments clink together. ǀ′′xadi, ǀ′′xadi, ǀ′′xadi, ǀ′′xadi. This is someone else."
At last she came, walking regally and slowly, and sat down by the water. The brothers dipped up mud from the waterhole and gave it to her. There was plenty of water but they gave her mud instead. She said softly "Yo. Why are you treating me this way? Why don't you give me clean water? If you're going to kill me, at least let me drink so the blood will flow freely." And they answered "That's perfectly clean water we've given you: why are you making such a fuss and calling it mud? Go ahead and drink."
Now, when she had left the camp she said to her grandmother, "I want to let you know that when I leave here I'm going to my death. I'm going to die. And this blood here in my heart, this blood will shoot out from between my shoulders. Now see that you grab it quickly and put it in a bag. Put it into a bag for me." Thus she had warned her grandmother.
So that's just what the old woman did. The brothers speared their sister-in-law, and the blood spurted from her and flew to her grandmother. The old lady took it and put it in a bag. And it grew and it grew until finally it was a fully-matured woman. First it grew two little teeth in its lower jaw. They grew and grew in the jaw just like any baby's teeth. The old woman took care of the little thing and sheltered it from other peoples' eyes. It went on growing and finally it began to crawl. It came out of the bag and crawled around. The old woman would come to the child and wash its face until its face sat clean on its little neck. Then she would play with it and flirt with it until it went back into the bag to sleep. The grandmother would tie the bag closed and it would go to sleep.
Once when the child was playing, the old woman said, "Yo, my daughter's child, look at the sand you have scratched up with all your crawling around!" Then she praised and played with the baby and talked to it until the other people said "Yo! who is the old lady talking to?" But she said "I'm just talking about the sand the <animal>animals</animal> have scratched up. I'm not doing anything but complaining about these <animal>animals</animal>." The others answered "Quit trying to fool us - what kind of talk is that?" But the grandmother kept on hiding her secret from them, and finally the girl was grown. She was full-grown and her breasts had swelled and she was very pretty. She was beautiful: after all, wasn't she <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName>?
She grew up and one day she sat pounding <plant>nǂhn</plant>. She pounded <plant>nǂhn</plant> branches into <color>red</color> powder, making a sound like "ǃKobo, ǃKobo, ǃKobo!" The others had gone gathering food and were returning to camp. They heard a sound of pounding. "Hey, who's pounding <plant>nǂhn</plant>?" they asked each other. "Who can it be, this person who's pounding <plant>nǂhn</plant>?" "You're mistaken," said the old woman, "nobody's pounding <plant>nǂhn</plant> here, I'm all alone. I'm just ... it's nothing ..." But they said "What in the world have you been doing, what is this, who is this person?" And they ran forward and embraced <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName>. They all greeted her: "Oh, my little niece, my namesake, my little sister, my this or that." They welcomed her and praised her, and they were all happy to be together again.
The next day they stayed together at that camp. And the next. They all lived there, and <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName>'s husband was hunting <animal>duikers</animal>. He killed <animal>duikers</animal>, and she found food like <animal>lizards</animal>, dung <animal>beetles</animal>, and <animal>mice</animal>. These were the foods she brought home, and her husband killed <animal>duikers</animal> and brought them home.
One day, <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName>'s mother took her granddaughter, <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName>'s child, and went out digging <plant>tshõ</plant> bulbs. The child saw the first bulbs and called out "Grannie, come dig up this <plant>tshõ</plant> bulb here." Her grandmother came to see, and said "ǁ′′oi-ǁ′′oi-s-a-ka-ǁ′′oi, hwi-kwi-s-a-ka-hwi! So here's where my son-in-law was chasing his <animal>duiker</animal> yesterday: his balls are scattered all over the sand!" (She meant the <plant>tshõ</plant> bulbs.) Her grandchild said "Grannie, grannie, are you insulting my father?" "Yo, what is this child talking about?" They argued back and forth all the way back to camp.
When they got there, the child's father was skinning a <animal>duiker</animal>. He took out its insides and said to the child, "Here, take these to your grandmother." But the child said "She insults my father and now he says I should carry her the <animal>duiker</animal>'s insides ...!" The grandmother said, "Are you crazy? When did I insult your father? Take the meat and go hang it up by my house for me." The child refused again, so the father just got up silently and took the meat. "If that's how you feel, I'll take it to your grandmother myself," he said. He picked up the meat. But first he hung it up while he fastened a skin around it. Then he took a big axe and stuck it inside the skin as well. He put the axe into the skin with the meat. He walked over to his mother-in-law. She reached up to accept the meat from him. He said, "Yo, what is all this about insults, hey? And besides, when you accept a gift, you don't just sit there. When you take something, you should bow your head and cast down your eyes." So his mother-in-law did as he said. With that he took out the axe and stood above her and chopped clean through the back of her neck. "Hehh!" her throat rattled as she died.
The blood spurted from her body, streams and streams of it. It was horrible. <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName>'s husband took the body out of the pool of blood, dragged it over to the hut, and lay it down inside.
All this while <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> had been away gathering food. She picked and gathered and at last she returned to the camp. She went to her hut and spread out what she had gathered. Then she drew aside a portion of it and gave it to her child. "Take this," she said, "and go give it to your grandmother." "Yo!" muttered the child. "Why is everybody sending me on errands today?" <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> said. "Yo! Get up and take this to your grandmother, I said! Why hasn't the old lady started a fire already to cook the things she brought so she can eat and go to bed?" So the child took it and went over to the hut. The grandmother lay there dead where her son-in-law had stretched out her body. Wondering at her silence, <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> went to see. "Oo! Did you repeat some story to your father that made him kill your grandmother? That caused her blood to spurt away and flow in a stream around the fire?"
<persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> went back to her own fire. She set down the food and began to eat. The fire was very smoky, and it made her eyes water. She was crying. When the smoke blew in her eyes, she cried even more. Her husband stared at her. "Yo!" he said. "What are you crying about?" "Yo!" she answered. "Why do you say that I'm crying when my eyes are just watering all by themselves? The fire is smoking right into my face and my eyes are watering, that's all! Why should I be crying?"
So they just sat and ate the food she had brought home. Her husband finished and went to sleep. When he was fast asleep, <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> began to pull out one of his spears. She wanted to slit her husband's throat. But the spear handles bumped noisily against each other, ǂdeǂdeǂdeǂde! Her husband woke up. He had heard the noise. "Yo! who's bumping spears together?" "Oh, it's nothing," she said. "My brothers are on the move today, and their spears must be making that sound. They are on their way to see me." With this the husband was satisfied, but <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> was still thinking what she could do to him. "Koo-oo!" she said to herself. "The big knife, that big knife as long as my arm! Am I going to let him escape it, now that he's killed mother? Why should I let such a person live?" So she very carefully hid the big knife behind herself and slipped it into the fire. It lay there and grew hot. Meanwhile her husband lay back and thought about taking his wife to bed with him. He was daydreaming lazily when suddenly, "Yo! Ye!" she'd cut his throat! <apartmyth>(Long ago, people sure did mischief to each other!)</apartmyth>
<persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> got busy then and buried her mother there. The next morning she made a bundle of her husband's blood and tucked it into the right side of her groin. She made a bundle of her mother's blood and tucked it into the left side of her groin. Then she sat down to wait. Soon her husband's younger brothers appeared. "Mmm," she said to herself. "Now what am I going to do?" When she greeted the brothers she said "Your older brother has gone off after a <animal>duiker</animal> like the one he killed yesterday. He is hoping to see another one, and if he does, he'll chase it. He'll be back later." <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName>'s child ran up and shouted "Uncle! Uncle! listen..." But <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> quickly gave the child her breast so that it would not talk. The brothers said, "Well, if he's not here, as you say, we won't stay. We're going to leave - you stay here with the children." And they left the camp.
Now <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> had already packed up her things early in the morning. She had packed little morningstar thorns, the kind that prick your feet, and ǁgami ǁgami thorns, those big ones that stab into your flesh. All sorts of thorns and prickly things she had gathered together and put into her kaross. Now she took one child and tucked it into the front of her kaross, and tucked the other child in back with its face turned backwards. She wanted this second child to help her watch out for her husband's brothers when they came after her.
Thus she got ready to go. They left the camp and were off. But the last thing she did was to take her husband's shoe and throw it into the sky. Then she took her mother's shoe and threw it into the sky too. The shoes turned into <animal>vultures</animal>, and began to fly away. "What? Aren't you going to eat all this nice meat here? Aren't you hungry? Where are you going?" cried <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName>, so that the <animal>vultures</animal> returned to circle the two corpses.
<persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> and her children fled. Now her husband's brothers had not gone very far along their way. When they were still fairly close to the deserted camp they saw the <animal>vultures</animal> come down for their brother and for <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName>'s mother. They went back to see what was happening, "Koo-oo-oo! Did our brother kill his mother-in-law, and has his wife killed him in return?" They ran to <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName>'s hut to look for her. But they couldn't find her, because she had already left. They searched for her but she was nowhere to be found. "Now we know what that child was trying to tell us," they said. "Now we know why she didn't ask us to stay,"
So they followed her footprints and tracked her. They tracked her and tracked her. The child who was turned backwards in <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName>'s kaross looked out and said, "Here come my uncles!" So <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> began to strew thorns in their path. She dropped handful after handful of thorns until they were thick upon the ground. When the brothers came to the thorns they thought they could walk through them but they couldn't find any place to put their feet down. They didn't know what to do. The thorns pricked them and stuck into them. They tried to walk but thorns stabbed into the soles of their feet and stayed there. They picked their way painfully through the thorns, and at last, somehow, they got out. But <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> had picked up the rest of the thorns and gone on.
So the brothers found her trail again and tracked her and tracked her until she had to strew thorns again. Again the brothers made their way through the thorns and got out of them somehow. By this time they were not far from the camp she was headed for. She was trying to get to the camp of her mother's people. When she got close to it, she spoke to the rain. "Why don't you do something? Don't you see I'm about to be killed? Give me just one cloud so the rain can come down and wipe out my footprints." So the rain made a cloud and hung it in the sky. Raindrops fell from it and washed away <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName>'s tracks. Then the rain beat upon her pursuers and they had to spend the night on the trail. They crouched somewhere out of the rain and waited and waited for it to stop. "What is this?" they said to each other. "Where can she have gone? She's just disappeared! Let's forget it and go home." When the rain stopped they went home. They stayed there and went about their business, and another day they came and killed her, killed their sister-in-law. <epimyth>These are the things of the old times; when ǁgauwa was there he made them happen.</epimyth>
