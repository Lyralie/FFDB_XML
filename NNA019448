Xatēʹtsᴇn was sitting in his house when his attendant came and said, "Don't sit here in the house, for somebody is coming to the beach here." - "Maybe this is what I am expecting, that will make things right on the beach." Then Xatēʹtsᴇn went out of his house to invite Q!āʹnēqēᵋlakᵘ. Then [Q!āʹnēqēᵋlakᵘ] entered the house of Xatēʹtsᴇn, and he was given dried [salmon to eat. It was dried] meat of the double-headed serpent. Q!āʹnēqēᵋlakᵘ began to eat it, and his body became contorted. Then Xatēʹtsᴇn spoke. "Don't urge our friend here [to eat]." Then Xatēʹtsᴇn and Q!āʹnēqēᵋlakᵘ went out of the house. Xatēʹtsᴇn looked at his salmon-weir. Then Q!āʹnēqēᵋlakᵘ transformed him into stone. Xatēʹtsᴇn became a man again, because he also had supernatural power. [He said,] "Go on, take warning, friend! Now I will also do something to you." Then Xatēʹtsᴇn transformed his friend into stone, but Q!āʹnēqēᵋlakᵘ became a man again. 
Then he warned Xatēʹtsᴇn. "Take warning, friend! Now I will try you again." They took hold of each other, and Q!āʹnēqēᵋlakᵘ held Xatēʹtsᴇn by his sides. He lifted him up. Then Xatēʹtsᴇn was transformed into fog. He became a man again. Then Xatēʹtsᴇn spoke. "Go on, take warning, friend! Now I will do something to you also." Then Xatēʹtsᴇn lifted Q!āʹnēqēᵋlakᵘ and threw him upward. Then Q!āʹnēqēᵋlakᵘ also became fog. Q!āʹnēqēᵋlakᵘ became a man again. 
<pb n="5"/>Then Q!āʹnēqēᵋlakᵘ spoke. "Go on, take warning, friend! Now I will try to lift you from the rock." Then Q!āʹnēqēᵋlakᵘ took hold of Xatēʹtsᴇn and threw him upward. He transformed Xatēʹtsᴇn into a crane, and the crane began to fly. Xatēʹtsᴇn became a man again. Then he also warned Q!āʹnēqēᵋlakᵘ. "Go on, take care, friend!" Then Xatēʹtsᴇn took hold of Q!āʹnēqēᵋlakᵘ and threw him upward. A crane was flying there. Q!āʹnēqēᵋlakᵘ became a man again. 
Then Xatēʹtsᴇn spoke. "Oh, indeed, you have supernatural power, friend! Come, let us go to my playground." Then they went aboard his canoe, and they paddled, going to Xatēʹtsᴇn's play-round. They were dressed quite with the same kind of belts; namely, double-headed serpents. Double-headed serpents also were their canoes. Then they arrived at the playground. 
Then Xatēʹtsᴇn spoke. "Take care, friend! else you might have a mishap on my playground. Nobody who ever tried to come and play on it has succeeded a single time. This is what makes it slippery, the blood of those who came from time to time to play here." Then Xatēʹtsᴇn spoke. "You go on first, friend!" Thus Q!āʹnēqēᵋlakᵘ was told by his friend. "[No,] you first," said Q!āʹnēqēᵋlakᵘ. "You said that it is your playground." - "Let me go first, friend," said Xatēʹtsᴇn, on his part. Then he [Q!āʹnēqēᵋlakᵘ] clapped on the gunwale of his canoe with his paddle, and Xatēʹtsᴇn ran up. Xatēʹtsᴇn ran straight up. He did not rest on his resting-place halfway up: he just turned round and came down again and jumped into his canoe. 
Then Xatēʹtsᴇn spoke. "Now you go, friend!" Thus he said to Q!āʹnēqēᵋlakᵘ. "Take care, fasten your belt well, else it might [drag] behind you!" Then Q!āʹnēqēᵋlakᵘ ran. He had nearly reached the top when he <pb n="7"/>slipped on the rock. His belt came off, and Q!āʹnēqēᵋlakᵘ fell down. He fell into the water and sank. Then Xatēʹtsᴇn went away to Q!āʹnēqēᵋlakᵘ's canoe, and upset it on the water. "Indeed, you have no real supernatural power, friend," thus he said while upsetting Q!āʹnēqēᵋlakᵘ's canoe. 
Xatēʹtsᴇn waited in vain for Q!āʹnēqēᵋlakᵘ to show himself, but Q!āʹnēqēᵋlakᵘ just did mischief to Xatēʹtsᴇn's land. Q Q!āʹnēqēᵋlakᵘ transformed into stone a beaver that was sitting by the river. Then Q!āʹnēqēᵋlakᵘ caught sight of the watchman at the salmon-weir of Xatēʹtsᴇn. He transformed into stone him and his pole. Then he also transformed into stone the watchman of Xatēʹtsᴇn. Then Xatēʹtsᴇn was vanquished by Q!āʹnēqēᵋlakᵘ, for Xatēʹtsᴇn did not know what Q!āʹnēqēᵋlakᵘ was doing.
