<pb n="81"/>A man went hunting with his blow-pipe. He shot a boweig monkey, a siamang and a binturong. He put all three animals in his back basket and went home. On the way he saw a tiger. When he arrived at the swidden he gave the meat to his wife to cook. They ate all the three meats, but his uncle [older than parent] who was a <ref target="g:GEE2143.032">putao</ref> would not eat the binturong together with the siamang.<note>Under no circumstances may binturong and siamang put in contact with each other. They cannot even be carried in the same backbasket.</note> He was afraid of tiger talaiden. In the night they all climbed trees to sleep. They were frightened that the tiger might come. 
The nephew brought his blowpipe with him up into the tree. During the night he kicked it and it fell to the ground. "I am going down for my blowpipe," he told his wife. "Oh, but what about the tiger?" said she. He took no notice of this and climbed down. Just before he reached the ground he felt something scratch his legs. "Hey, there are lots of thorns here," he shouted to his wife, but it was the claws of the tiger waiting for him at the bottom of the tree. The tiger bit him in the throat and the man died. "I'll sleep in the house over there for the rest of the night," called out the tiger to the wife, pretending to be the husband. The tiger ate the body and the blood of the man, but he did not eat the head. He then tried to climb the tree in which the uncle was sleeping, but he could not do so for the uncle had placed a knife in the trunk and said spells over it that the tiger was unable to pass. 
The next day the uncle went hunting. He shot a boweig monkey, a tayog monkey and a squirrel. The head of his nephew's ghost followed him all the way. It wanted to capture his uncle's <ref target="g:GEE2143.036">ruwai</ref>, but he could not take it for the uncle had said spells. 
In the evening the uncle went home. The head of his nephew's ghost followed him. The uncle plaited headbands and riding. They made <ref target="g:GEE2143.025">n√∂poh</ref> for seven nights<note>Because of the unusual circumstances of the death, a normal expulsion ceremony of one night is not sufficient. Also riding are not made for ordinary funeral ceremonies.</note>. They wanted to expel the ghost. After seven nights the ghost vanished.
