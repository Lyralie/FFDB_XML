Once Bongso was out hunting. He came to a indugn tree. Here he stopped to listen, and he heard someone chanting, "gule gule mau, gule gule mau"<note>This legend is full of suggestive symbolism which I will attempt to interpret here. The chant of the old toad made audiences laugh, but I was told that it did not have any special meaning.</note>. He met a toad who told him that it was the "ghost" (sotn)<note>Ghost is clearly an unsatisfactory translation of this word. This myth was told me by the Western Chewong and they use sotn where the Eastern Chewong use yinlugen. What is indicated by the use of yinlugen is that the animals in question are more than animals, and more than possessors of consciousness. They are somehow "wrong" and have to be destroyed.</note> of an old toad who was singing "gule gule mau, gule gule mau." The "ghost" was very, very old. 
Bongso went on. He had brought a banana with him. He arrived at the toad house. It was full of toads. "Come in, Bongso," they said when they saw him. They gave him food, and they all went to sleep. In the night the old toad "ghost" who had been chanting "gule gule mau, gule gule mau" died. Bongso tied his hind legs together. "I want the tail," said the daughter. Bongso gave her a piece of cloth and this she ate. The other toads cooked people stew<note>The toad "ghosts" behave like ke√≤i or nlab in so far as they eat human meat. They also eat their own kind.</note> and served it as ordinary stew. Bongso did not want any. He knew what was in it: human flesh and the old toad "ghost". When she had eaten, the toad daughter went to the river to bathe. Her two children stayed behind. Bongso cut off the boy's penis and put it in the girl's vagina. Then he set fire to the house. The toad "ghosts" became true toads from then on.
