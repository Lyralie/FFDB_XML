ᵋnᴇmōʼgwis travelled northward, coming from Seymour Narrows. He made war upon the people and destroyed many villages. Finally he went up Nimkish River, and came to the mountain Ts!ᴇx·ēʼwakᵘ. There he acquired supernatural power. A goose [nᴇlaʼ] came to live with him, assumed the form of a person, and became the ancestor of his tribe. They lived in Foundation [Xulkᵘ]. When the goose assumed the shape of a person, his wife also became a human being, and they had many children. They came to be a bad people. ᵋnᴇmōʼgwis and the goose are the ancestors of the Sīʼsᴇnʟēᵋ. 
ᵋnᴇmx·āʼlikō is also given as the name of the ancestors of the Sīʼsᴇnʟēᵋ.
