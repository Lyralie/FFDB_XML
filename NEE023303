<pb n="19"/>Once there was a young woman, Bongso, who lived alone with her squirrel pet in a house on its own. One day she and the squirrel went out into the jungle. She found one mango fruit lying on the ground by itself. "Oh look, a mango," she said, and bending down she picked it up and put it in her sling. When she got home she placed the mango in a basket for it was not yet ripe enough to be eaten. She cooked some rice and some vegetables and ate. There was still some left in the saucepan. Then she went to sleep. In the night the mango, which was really a man who had put on a mango "cloak" (<ref target="g:GEE2143.004">bajo</ref> limos), got out of the basket. He took off the mango cloak and put it aside. Then he finished up the rice and the vegetables that the girl had left in the saucepan. Having eaten, he smoked her tobacco and ate her betel nuts. Then he lay down next to the girl and went to sleep. In the early morning before the sun was up, the man arose and, putting on his mango cloak, he returned to the basket. When she woke, the girl thought she would finish off the leftovers from the night before. She went to get them but when she opened the lid they had all gone. She could not understand what had happened, but she cooked herself some more before going out fishing. 
In the evening she returned and having prepared and cooked the fish and some rice she went to sleep. There were left-overs of her meal which she planned to eat the following morning. When he saw that she was fast asleep, the mango man came out of his basket, took off his mango cloak and ate, smoked and chewed betel nuts as he had the night before. Then he lay down next to his wife and went to sleep until just before daybreak, when he put on the mango cloak and returned to the basket. In the morning the girl found the empty saucepans. "Are there people about?" she asked herself when she saw this. She was baffled, but cooked some more and went out fishing again. She remembered the mango she had found and said to her squirrel, "I have forgotten about the mango we found. I must remember to eat it. It should be ripe now." But when she got home in the evening with her day's catch she forgot all about the mango. She cooked and ate as she had on the previous nights, and when she was asleep the mango man emerged from his basket and ate the rest of the food. The same thing happened the following day and the day after. Then the girl decided to find out who was eating her food in the night. She went into the jungle and found pangogn leaves which resemble the <ref target="g:GEE2143.038">sirih</ref> leaves eaten with betel nuts but which are poisonous. She then found some hibol fruit which look just like the betel nuts, but are also poisonous. She substituted these for the real <ref target="g:GEE2143.038">sirih</ref> leaves and betel nuts in the pouch in which she kept them, and having eaten, she lay down pretending to go to sleep. After a while, the mango man emerged from the basket. 
He took off his mango cloak and placed it on the floor, then he went over to the saucepans. The girl watched what he was doing. "The mango I forgot all about!" she said to herself. Then she crept up and took the mango cloak and destroyed it. When the man had eaten and smoked he took the betel nut pouch and ate the leaves and the fruit inside. No sooner did he chew it before he yelled out in pain, "<pb n="20"/>I have been poisoned!" He ran over to get his mango cloak, but could find it nowhere. "My cloak, where is my cloak?" he exclaimed. Then the girl stood up and said, "I have taken it. I don't want a mango man." Then she blew magical smoke (<ref target="g:GEE2143.027">òz taba</ref>)<note><ref target="g:GEE2143.027">Òz taba</ref> used during <ref target="g:GEE2143.025">nöpoh</ref> is a necessary ingredient for all acts which involve esoteric practices. <ref target="g:GEE2143.026">Òz</ref> means fire, or firewood; taba is the agila tree.

The man became well again, and Bongso gave him a real shirt instead of the mango one that she had destroyed. Then they slept together and became husband and wife.
