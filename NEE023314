<pb n="67"/>A man and his grandfather went hunting with dogs. They came across a monitor lizard. The monitor lizard ran up into a tree and the grandfather followed. While he was high up in the tree, it fell over and the grandfather was killed.<note>To be killed by a falling tree is always very bad. It means that one's ruwai does not die, but is taken by two superhuman beings who live in the clouds. In this story something went wrong and the grandfather's ghost, rather than being expelled to the Afterworld, stayed on Earth and pursued his grandson. I could obtain no further explanation.</note> The man went back to the lean-to they had built on the ground. Here he made a fire. The ghost (yinlugen) of his grandfather followed him. He was scratching his head. "Have a look at my head, grandson," said he, "I have so many lice." While saying this he put his head forward and shook it. Lots of maggots fell out. The man got up and ran away as fast as he could. He ran to a hollow tree which he entered and he wanted to make it his house for the night. He made a fire. The ghost followed after him, however, and again he asked his grandson to pick his lice as he was itching terribly. When he shook his hair maggots fell out and the man got up and ran away. This time he reached his own house. "What is the matter?" asked his mother, "where is grandfather?" "He got killed by a falling tree," replied the son. "Oh," said his mother. The man then made a fire underneath the ladder to the house. In the evening the ghost arrived. He went up the ladder, but this collapsed into the fire with the ghost. The ghost became pralogen [a species of a cicada]. It is the yinlugen of long ago that we hear at night these days.
