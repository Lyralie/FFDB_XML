<pb n="110"/>All the young girls in a settlement refused to drum for the <ref target="g:GEE2143.025">n√∂poh</ref> ceremony because they said that the men sang so badly. One day Bongso came to the house of his aunt (<ref target="g:GEE2143.003">baha</ref>). His aunt's daughter was there and Bongso liked her very much. In the evening he sang. The girls in other houses heard his singing. It was very beautiful, so they ran over to see who it was. They saw Bongso singing and they entered his aunt's house and started fondling him. He did not want this. He liked his cousin only. He became frightened by so many girls fondling him, so he ran away and became a hang [flying gecko].
