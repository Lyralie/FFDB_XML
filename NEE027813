I went to hunt along my [own] river, I made a hut. The next day I made an 'inau'; an 'inau' outside the hut. The second day, I went out to set snares; I went to set snares, [and] spent the night [out]. For two days I set the snares. With the day when I went out to set snares, for three days was I busy setting snares. On my return, I looked at the snares. Very many animals were taken, somewhat I wondered as it were.
[That] being [so], I was much gratified; I made a very <pb n="134"/>large bundle [of them]. Having arrived at [the tree] nearest to the hut [forming] a bridge [over the stream] whereon I had set snares, I looked forward; from my hut the smoke rises! I was astonished, nevertheless I went thither. Having arrived at the side of the hut, when I listened, I heard a noise of cooking. Therefore I thought: "What man, having come, sits in the hut?" Thus thinking, I entered. 
Suddenly, as I looked ... my wife it was, [when] I entered! When I looked at the hearth, [she] was cooking as I entered; I sat down in my place; when I had taken off my boots, she asked me for my boots. So I gave her my boots. In [my] soul thus thought I: "Lo, what have I met [with!] I thought she was not really my wife; I thought she would make me rich". 
I looked well [on her]: just exactly my wife! [Her] face [was] very joyful. We spent the night; we lay apart. The next day, at dawn, when she rose, she busied herself with cooking. When I rose afterwards, and when I had done refreshing [my] face with water, I ate. When I had done eating, then did the young woman speak as follows: "When <pb n="135"/>I go forth, I will show thee the place [to which] I shall go". Thus speaking, she went out. 
I thought that this was a she-bear. So having prepared an 'inau', and holding it, I looked [following her]; all at once, with a shake [of the sides], she turned into a she-bear. Therefore in terror did I place 'inaus' wherever [she had been], [and] having offered [them to her], I then passed the night. The next day I looked at [my] snares. Beginning with the tree-bridge nearest to the hut, [the bridge] with snares, I took a great many animals, I killed very many pine-martens. 
Now, I had ended the setting of snares. In the summer, when I went hunting, I took many things with hands. In the sea, when I hunted [there], I likewise took many things with hands. I was most lucky. Being lucky, I was a great [man and a] wealthy; I lived very well.
