<pb n="177"/>In the old days some people went to Kaluwéllawaia. There are many lakúma there but these people did not know that. Soon the lakúma came out, and all the people lost their canoes; they barely saved their lives by swimming to a beach but there was no wood there. For a long time they were without fire and finally ran out of food. But on the other side was a beautiful place with plenty of food. One day a man saw something floating on the surface of the water; it was quite wide and flat. Soon more such pieces appeared. He looked closely and saw that they were lakúma lying there next to one another. They became so numerous that they stretched from one shore to the other. They lay very quietly. One of the men said: "If we run quickly over them we'll get to the other shore!" He did so. He ran quickly, and reached the opposite shore. Right after him the two other men and the women and children also tried it. But they walked much too slowly and all the lakúma submerged; they disappeared into the water taking all the people with them. The lakúma will seriously harm anybody who comes within their reach. 
Only the one man, who was a great yékamuš, saved himself. He went to the other people, called them together, and reported everything. He said: "Now we must make many yékuš and kill those lakúma down there!" The men went to work. They advanced against the lakúma and killed many of them. The latter were lying on the bottom. Nowadays, when you come to this place you will see many flat stones on the bottom. These are all those lakúma which on that occasion went slowly under with the people flattening themselves out and which are still lying in the water there in that spot.
