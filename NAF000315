ǃXõǁəmdima's heart's blood was shed.
She went off and was killed. Her heart's blood flew back to the camp and perched upon her grandmother's upper back. Her grandmother took it and put it in a bag. The blood lay there and grew inside the bag. It grew until it was a woman again. The children of the village saw her and cried out "Auntie! Auntie!" Her nieces saw her and greeted her with joy. She had grown completely, and she came out of the bag and sat in the middle of the camp. That's what ǃXõǁəmdima did. She grew and grew and grew until she was finished growing. Then the <animal>elephant</animal> (or was it the <animal>kori bustard</animal>?) came to marry her. Anyway, a new husband came and married her.
Now ǃXõǁəmdima's mother one day took her namesake, ǃXõǁəmdima's daughter, and they went out digging <plant>tshõ</plant>. For awhile they dug quietly. Then ǃXõǁəmdima's mother said "Uh! These <plant>tshõ</plant> bulbs look like my son-in-law was chasing through here after some <animal>animal</animal> and his balls went 'ǃoh ǃoh' and fell to the ground!" Her little granddaughter just stood there and listened.
Back at the camp, the little girl's father, ǃXõǁəmdima's husband, had brought home a <animal>duiker</animal> that he had killed. He skinned it and butchered it. When the old woman and her granddaughter came home, he said to the little girl, "Here, take this meat to your Grannie to cook for you." But the child refused. Her father repeated "Ai, you take it to your Grannie so she can cook it for you." But the little girl said "Why should I take meat to someone who says when my father is out chasing <animal>duikers</animal> his balls go 'ǃoh ǃoh' and fall to the ground?"
Well, her father didn't say a word. He just picked up a hatchet and stuck it in the top of his loincloth. Then he picked up the <animal>duiker</animal>'s insides. Last he wrapped himself in a <animal>gemsbok</animal> kaross to conceal the hatchet. Then he went over to his mother-in-law's hut.
The old lady reached up to take the <animal>duiker</animal> meat from him. But he said "No, that's not the way to do it. When you receive a gift you must bow your head. That's it, bow your head and take it as I hand it to you." His mother-in-law bowed her head. Quickly he chopped through the back of her neck with the hatchet. She died, and lay still. Her son-in-law went back to his own hut and hung up the <animal>duiker</animal>'s liver.
Now his wife ǃXõǁəmdima had been out gathering <plant>bush</plant> food, and in a while she returned. "Go see about Grannie" she said to her child.
"No," said the child; "I won't."
"Why is my mother so quiet?" wondered ǃXõǁəmdima. Finally she went to see for herself. "Oof!" she gasped. Her mother's blood had been spilled: it had flowed to the edge of the fire and dried there. "Yi!" said ǃXõǁəmdima. She covered her mother's body and went back to her own hut.
She fanned up her fire. Then she sat in the path of its smoke. When the wind changed, she went to sit where the smoke would blow in her face. Tears ran from her eyes. Her husband said, "Move out of the smoke! Your eyes are watering! Why are you trying to sit right in the smoke?" But she answered "No, the fire is just smoking, and I just happen to be sitting in the way." All the while she was crying, she kept following the smoke to conceal the cause of her tears. Her husband took up his bow and played. "Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wo, wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wo!"
"Yes, play on your bow, stretch your neck out for me," thought ǃXõǁəmdima. Her husband played on his big bow; he lay on his back and sang. ǃXoǁəmdima laid an awl in the fire. It lay there and began to get hot. She fanned up the fire and it got hotter. She fanned the fire until the awl was <color>red</color>-hot. "Shidididi!" Went the awl into his neck. "ǁgãi!" she heard his death-rattle. "Didn't my mother go ǁgãi before you? Her breath rattled in her throat, and now yours will, as well," said ǃXõǁəmdima to her husband.
Well, he died, and she covered his body like she had covered her mother's body. Her mother lay there dead and her husband lay there dead as well. In the morning she got up. She took her husband's shoes and threw them one way, and took her mother's shoes and threw them the other way. The shoes turned into <animal>vultures</animal>. Her husband's shoes she threw in the air, and then threw her mother's shoes, and all the shoes turned into <animal>vultures</animal>.
Then her husband's brothers arrived at the camp. They looked around and said "Yo! Where has older brother gone?"
"He went off in that direction someplace," replied ǃXõǁəmdima.
"He went off in that direction? Then where's the old lady?"
"The old lady went this way. She's gone to look around over this way. My husband said he was going to look for <animal>duikers</animal> over that way," ǃXõǁəmdima lied.
Her brothers-in-law wondered at what she said. "Ai!" they said, "Has he really just gone hunting?" Again they asked her where he had gone.
"He's gone hunting, he's off over there," she said to them.
So they sat and waited. They sat for awhile and then they got up and left. As they walked away they said among themselves "Someone has killed him, but what have they done with him?"
All this while the <animal>vultures</animal> were circling in the sky. Now they came down on one body; now they came down on the other. "What the ...? Why are these <animal>vultures</animal> coming down just as we are passing by - just look at what these <animal>vultures</animal> are doing! Here is a flock of <animal>vultures</animal> here, there is another flock over there!" They had never seen such a thing. "That woman over there is a murderess," they declared. "She must have killed our brother. This is where she killed him. By those <animal>vultures</animal> over there and these <animal>vultures</animal> here, she has murdered him. And she told us nothing was wrong - that he had gone off hunting!"
"Well, now we've seen what really happened; let's go!"
The brothers made ǃXõǁəmdima pack up her things to leave with them. She picked up her daughter and said, "Which way to your camp?"
"If we cut across here we'll get there," they answered. Well, they walked and walked and walked. "When will we get there?" asked ǃXõǁəmdima.
"Be patient: we'll get there in a little while," they said.
They walked some more. "Where is this camp?" she asked. "It's pretty far, but when we've crossed this stretch we'll come to it."
"All right." So they travelled and travelled and travelled and again she said, "We've walked so far already: when will we get there?"
"We're almost there now," the brothers said.
Soon they came upon people who were gathering bush food. "We're close to the camp now. Do you see that tree standing over there? The camp is beneath it."
So they walked and walked and trudged and trudged and at last they arrived at the camp. Just before they went into the circle of huts, ǃXõǁəmdima took out her magical <animal>gemsbok</animal> horn, "ǂdeǂdeǂdeǂde! Kum-kums-a-ka-kum!" She blew. All the people in the camp fell dead. The men who had brought ǃXõǁəmdima all that way fell dead. The people who were gathering in the <plant>bush</plant> fell dead. She had flattened them all! Then she fled from that camp and went back to the camp she had come from. <epilogue>That woman! She and her people certainly had adventures!</epilogue>
