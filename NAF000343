<anamyth>This is the story of the moon and the <animal>hare</animal>.</anamyth> The moon said to the <animal>hare</animal>, "Hey! Let it be that when a person dies, he'll live again. He won't just die: he'll come back to life."
The <animal>hare</animal> answered "No. When a person dies he will smell bad. And he will never get up again."
The moon asked him "And what about you, the <animal>hare</animal>, if you die: don't you think you will get up again?"
"Yes, even if I die I don't think I'll ever get up again," said the <animal>hare</animal>.
So they began to argue, and to fight. The moon took a shoe and struck the <animal>hare</animal>'s upper lip. Then they separated. The <animal>hare</animal> went one way, the moon went the other, into the east. The moon became the moon, and hung in the sky. The <animal>hare</animal> became an <animal>animal</animal>. And they were separate from then on.
