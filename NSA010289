The two Yoálox were extremely intelligent men. When their mother had reached a very advanced age she finally lost all her strength. Thus she lay there and a profound sleep came over her. Then she no longer moved. The two Yoálox cried bitterly for they had lost their mother and were alone now. They took her outside and buried her. But the younger Yoálox loved his mother less; he did not cry nearly as loud nor as much as his elder brother. 
Their mother had been buried for some time when one day they heard her voice outside, near the hut. Suddenly the elder Yoálox stopped crying and declared: "I shall cry no longer for I hear my mother's voice!" He hurried out of the hut, hoping to see her there. The younger Yoálox remained in the hut and shouted furiously at his mother: "Why are you coming back here? Leave us at once and stay away forever!" Then the mother retreated very slowly never to return <pb n="60"/>again. The younger Yoálox only said, as though displeased with himself: "Why didn't we tell our mother right away not to return any more!"<note>These words mean: why did we not early enough, and at the right moment, prevent our mother from arising from the sleep of death.</note> And indeed, after that she stayed away forever.
