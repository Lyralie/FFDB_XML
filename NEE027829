I lived in my village. - Ah, it was splendid! - Hearing that the wife of a wealthy man of Near-Turupan was famous amongst the gods, I had envious thoughts. Therefore I made myself a pipe-holder [the same as this] old man's. This old pipe-holder I thrust into my girdle, [and] gave the man of Near-Turupan a mind to visit Far-Turupan. I heard that he had gone to Far-Turupan. 
Therefore I took the form of the old man. On my head I put a small turban, [like] the old man's. Forth from my house I came into the yard, [and] went on the way where [men] go. On the way, I loosened two tree-stumps, and set [them] upside down; I seized [the roots of] these trees and <pb n="143">gave them the seeming of men: [as] manservants I made [them]. They made themselves little bundles and came together [with me] along the way. 
From the farther side of the cape we went towards Near-Turupan, along the seashore. I imitated the gait of the wealthy man of Near-Turupan. Presently we arrived at Near- Turupan. We came to a path which led to [his] house. With slow steps I imitated [him] along that path. - Ah! it was splendid! - I took the door handle, and opened, and through the door I entered the house. Having looked before me [I saw that] she I spoke of was sitting. 
The wife of the wealtly man of Near-Turupan [was] a woman whose like I had not known: a woman having a godlike face. She moved to one side, and I came close to her. I sat down in the place of the master of the house, having sighed. "I went out, and half-way I had no mind, and so half-way to this village I came back", lying I spoke [thus]. 
The wife of the Near-Turupan man could not look at me. She thought [I] was [her] husband, and though she smiled <pb n="144">a little, yet she did not look. I arranged [so as] to speak like the Near-Turupan man. The mistress of the house, after a talk, rose up, and gave me to eat of the soup [made] for the weary; and to all the men [there] she dealt out food. 
When they had done eating [the soup], various vegetables in plenty did she give to them. When they had done, she made a bed for guests. For the men that had come with me did she made a hospitable bed. Those men went and lay down on [their]hospitable beds. Having seen [this], the mistress covered the embers. When it was finished I lay down with the wife, but sleep I could not. 
My wife slept, and snored rhythmically. Thinking it was just midnight, I struck the woman between the breasts, I caught hold of her soul, and I escaped. To my house I carried [her] and fed [her]; made [her my] wife, and rejoiced with her; I could not go out. 
Through the birds did I hear that the Near-Turupan man had returned to his village. By the side of the road lay <pb n="145">his wife's body, being decomposed. Having perceived, he was much grieved. Now, there dwelt at one end of the village, male Shamans - six Shamans - all brothers. At the other end of the village, there dwelt female Shamans - six Shamans. 
They brought [thither] all the male Shamans. All these Shamans they made to perform the Shaman rites. Though they did thus, their eyes did not reach [to me, for] I covered [them and] none of the Shamans perceived me. At last the youngest Shaman nearly set eyes on me. When he had done so, I caught bold of a bunch of grass, and waved it upwards, [and thus] caused many mountains to spring up as a defence; [and] he saw me not. 
All those Shamans [then] they led away from the house; afterwards they brought the female Shamans. Six women Shamans they brought [them] all, [and] they made them perform the Shaman rites. The youngest woman nearly set eyes on me, [and said]: "Now a fox [is become] a were-wolf, and has lived without a wife. Therefore on purpose did he cause thy desire to go to Far-Turupa. When thou wentest to <pb n="146">Far-Turupa, after thee did he come; lo, he caught hold of thy wife's soul, bore [it] away to his house, made [her] his wife; and now lives rejoicing with his wife. To-morrow, in the daytime, ye shall surely go to fight [him]". So she said. 
What it was, I know not, [but] I could not sleep; [thus] I spent the night till daybreak. About noon, in the yard of my house, two persons' talk [occurred]. Meanwhile a noise of flames at [my] doors [was heard] through the apertures. The extremity of the flame drew nigher; so [that] I could not look [at it]. 
I pushed my wife, and made [of her] a small bird; into my mouth I put her, and ran about within [my] house. Two door-openings there were. Through one opening a tongue [of flame] from the wood burning [in the house] came outside into the yard; so I leapt after it into the yard, alighting there. At the same time, upon my body there fell two pieces of wood: it was [to me] as a bad dream".
