[Amongst] the Tungus in very old times [there] lived two men; a poor Tungus, together with his father. Also there lived a rich Tungus, together with his wife. Now the rich Tungus went a-hunting with his dog every year. He killed very many <pb n="138"/>pine-martens, and otters, and foxes "Kye!" When this poor Tungus went a-hunting, he killed ten otters, ten pine-martens, and ten foxes yearly. So the rich Tungus heard [of this].
That year the poor Tungus, having done setting snares for pine-martens, went a hunting with [his] dog. Having gone a-hunting with [his] dog, he spent the night [thus]; again he went [farther], again he spent the night. Doing thus daily, he came to the village of the rich Tungus. He entered the house; the man was absent, only a woman was [there] "Kye!!" When he looked round [he saw] the house was quite full of otter skins, [hanging in] clusters, of pine-marten skins [hanging in] clusters, of fox-skins [hanging in] clusters. He liked [that sight] very much. The good woman was cooking. "Kye!!" She gave to eat to this poor Tungus. 
When he had done eating, he asked [her]: "Whither is thy husband gone?" - "A hunting with a dog is he gone, and is not [here]; the day after to-morrow will he come"; so she said. Afterwards, this poor Tungus spent the night there. In the night, they went to bed. "Kye!!" That night, this poor <pb n="139"/>Tungus desired copulation. But the woman said thus: "[I] spit [on thee]! Now then, good for nothing Tungus, now then! I will not give myself to copulation. 
Hitherto, whilst I have lived, what have I lacked from my husband? I hunger for nothing; what then shall I want [to get] of this wretched Tungus? What shall I ask him for? I will not give myself to copulation; I spit [on thee], filthy [one]!" So she said. The poor Tungus was angered. Afterwards, at daybreak, this poor Tungus, not eating [anything], went out and away. Thereafter, this poor Tungus dwelt in his village. 
"Kye!!" Yearly, when he went a hunting, a hundred [head], two hundred [head] a year did he kill. The poor Tungus heard [that] the rich Tungus had died that year: [so] he heard. After that, some time passed by. From that year, when six years had passed by, [she that had been] the wife of the rich Tungus came [to him]; into the house of the poor Tungus did she enter. When the people saw [her, they saw that] she [looked] quite starved. 
<pb n="140"/>Thereupon the woman asked the master of the house to pity her and take her to wife; [for] living since her husband's death, she had no possibility to feed herself. Therefore now she had come to [that] house: if he would not take her to wife, he might take her for a servant to carry water. So she said. 
"Kye!!" This [formerly] poor man said: "[I] spit [on thee]! and now thou knowest that I am rich. Formerly, when I desired copulation: '[I] spit [on thee]!' so saidst thou; why, when thou hast no resource [dost thou come'] ... 'I shall want [to get] nothing of this wretched Tungus; what shall I ask him for? I will not give myself to copulation'; so saidst thou. Whatsoever thou shalt say, even till death, shall not enter my ears. If thou goest out into [my] yard, even shouldst thou die there ... good!" So he said. 
The woman weeping withdrew; going into the yard, she died. Therefore the ancient Tungus made [of this] a tradition. Therefore the Tungus [women] that live now, when they see any poor man, wish exceedingly for copulation. Such <pb n="141"/>is the tradition from the beginning. The Tungus women that live now make the first advances with any man whomsoever.
