Long ago it happened that the hyena killed a steenbok. He wanted to take it to the people who would give him his markings with fire. But at his own camp he found the jackal. The jackal was a person, and he had already had his branding, and was lying down.
When the hyena came, the jackal told him "That camp over there is full of strong medicine. Please don't go there - those people will kill you." But the hyena paid him no mind. He left and went to the branding camp.
When he got there the people placed long irons in the fire to heat. Then they told him to lie down. So the hyena lay down. Then the people burned him with the hot irons. He jumped up and ran off. The people took a sack of bones and threw it after him. The sack wrapped itself around the hyena's neck. The people yelled after him, "Go away and turn into a hyena. Just spend your life eating bones." And the hyena was a hyena and has gone about eating bones ever since.
