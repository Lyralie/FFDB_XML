<persName>ǀʼumaǀʼumane</persName> and the Goba saw some <animal>cows</animal>. The Goba was a rich man, and he said the <animal>cows</animal> were his. Now the <animal>cows</animal> had no pen. So the Goba told <persName>ǀʼumaǀʼumane</persName> to watch the <animal>cows</animal> for him in the bush. <persName>ǀʼumaǀʼumane</persName> sat down in the shade to watch them.
After awhile along came a second Goba. "Whose <animal>animals</animal> are these?" he asked.
"They're mine," replied <persName>ǀʼumaǀʼumane</persName>.
"Oh. Well, why don't we drive your <animal>animals</animal> back to the village rather than leave them out here in the bush?"
<persName>ǀʼumaǀʼumane</persName> agreed that would be a good idea. So they drove the <animal>cows</animal> home to the village. When they got there, one of the <animal>cows</animal> gave birth. The Goba said "Let's milk this <animal>animal</animal> and see how the milk tastes."
But <persName>ǀʼumaǀʼumane</persName> was afraid of the <animal>cow</animal>. "You tie her up - I'm afraid," he said. So the Goba took a leather thong and tied up the <animal>cow</animal>. Then he sat down and milked her until his bucket was full. Then he brought the milk to the fire. "Wash that pot standing there," he said to <persName>ǀʼumaǀʼumane</persName>. "Then cook the milk and let's taste it. Have you ever drunk this kind of milk before?"
"No, I've never tasted it," said <persName>ǀʼumaǀʼumane</persName>.
So he washed the pot as the Goba told him to, and began to cook the milk. The milk thickened into porridge. <persName>ǀʼumaǀʼumane</persName> took it off the fire and set it aside to cool. Then the Goba said "Come on, let's eat." But <persName>ǀʼumaǀʼumane</persName> said "No: you eat first and then give me the pot to lick." So the Goba ate and ate, <pb n="107"/>and then picked up the pot and handed it to <persName>ǀʼumaǀʼumane</persName>. <persName>ǀʼumaǀʼumane</persName> sat down and scraped out the leavings from the sides of the pot.
Then they both stood up. <persName>ǀʼumaǀʼumane</persName> said, "Here, take this thong, and I'll grab hold of this string. Let's see which one of us can pull harder than the other one." <persName>ǀʼumaǀʼumane</persName> took the string end, and the Goba grasped the leather thong. They began a tug of war. They pulled and strained on the rope so that it snapped in two. <persName>ǀʼumaǀʼumane</persName> tumbled into the bush. The Goba fell in the other direction, toward the east. As he fell, he shouted after <persName>ǀʼumaǀʼumane</persName>, "Good riddance to you! These <animal>cows</animal> will henceforth belong to me. And you will bow down to me and be my servant."
Since that day <persName>ǀʼumaǀʼumane</persName> and the Goba have gone their separate way. The Goba eats meat and drinks milk. He plants <plant>sorghum</plant> and <plant>corn</plant> and eats those things too. But <persName>ǀʼumaǀʼumane</persName> has only bush food to eat, things like <plant>nǀn</plant>, <plant>komako</plant>, and <plant>ǃgwa</plant> berries. <epimyth>That's the story of how <persName>ǀʼumaǀʼumane</persName> lost his <animal>cows</animal> and became an inferior person.</epimyth>
