Joś śere kere! ... In the land of Rurupa I grew up with the household of my uncle. My uncle had two wives. My uncle who bred me grudged me [my] food. In the time when my uncle was not [there], my two aunts fed me by stealth. When he was [there], he sorely grudged me [my] food; he chid me, he chid [me]. Having a childish mind, I wept in secret. That day [they] made much saké. 
Meanwhile one aunt [of] mine made shoes of fish-skin, [and] one of my aunts made robes [padded] with cotton. When I counted in my mind, the aunt who made robes [padded] [223] with cotton made six robes [padded] with cotton. [And] one [of] my aunt[s] made six [pair of] shoes of [fish]-skin. When they had done, when it was dark, I laid myself down [to sleep]. When I had lain down, [there] came a noise to me from two directions; as I woke, my aunt - [the one who] made shoes of [fish]-skin - touched the tip of my ear, and quietly spoke thus: 
"Being whom I have fed, since I speak, listen well to me. Thy uncle, a wealthy man, as making saké, is making saké for thee. When the saké has fermented, he will invite thy kindred. The people who will drink saké, at the time of drinking it, will quarrel; when they shall rise, they [being] under the influence of the saké, will slay thee. To look on whilst they slay thee ... it is too evil [a thing]! Therefore escape! 
Afterwards, when thou shalt come to the river-bank, [thou shalt see] on the river bank a large ash-tree standing, with beautiful bark; on a branch [of it] [there] is a bundle of [fish]-skin shoes, and a bundle of garments [padded] with cotton. In the space around there is a storehouse filled with thin [224] skins [of fishes]. Thereinto if thou goest, take of dried [fish], take as much as thou wilt. Thence when thou goest down, thou shalt go to a storehouse of rice. Take rice, as much as thou wilt. 
After this, take the bundle of garments: one pair of [fish]- skin shoes shalt thou put on; one garment shalt thou put on. Afterwards wade along the river, and night and day go against the stream. Where this river is [near] disappearing, along its tributary [that runs] from the West, do thou walk on, [and] thou shalt come unto [certain] bare mountains. Thou shalt make a shed with fir-branches, [and] there shalt thou be. Until thy provisions be ended, [there] shalt thou be. Trusting in [thy] god, thou shalt do thus". 
Thus she spoke. Then I rose; quietly I got ready. When I went out, I made no noise. When I went out into the courtyard, I went up into the storehouse. I took [several pair of] thin [fish]-shoes. As many as I wished did I take. Thence [225] I came down, and entered the rice storehouse. And of rice also I took as much as I wished. 
Afterwards, having done, I went away. Then, when I went away, I came to the riverbank. - Really there was an ash-tree with beautiful bark! On a branch [of it] there was a bundle of [fish]-skin shoes and a bundle of garments. Having taken [them], I made [one] bundle [of them]. One pair of [fish]-skin shoes I put on, and one garment I put on. Afterwards I waded in to the river, and walked up [the stream]. 
Meantime it became dark. [Whilst I was] wading in the night, the day broke. In the daytime too I waded. When I counted in my mind, six days I waded, six nights. At length, when I came to the highest point of the river, the tributary from the West was dried up. I went up [those] bare mountains. Afterwards I made myself a shed of fir-branches. 
Joś śere kere! At last [being] satisfied, I ate. Both night and day I ate: I did. At last the provisions sufficed [me] for two months. Finally there was little food. Only a little [226] rice was there; two days, three days I spent. Now I lived without eating at all. Afterwards I lay down to die. 
Counting in my mind, six nights, six days, did I spend [thus]. Now, the want of food had injured my health; had completely broken my health. I lived with hollow cheeks, with cheeks fallen in. That day [there] was a noise of two women walking; they entered. Such women I had not known [yet]. From the upper part of their faces there rose up beams [of light], [they] illuminated the fir-branch hut with [those] beams. Looking shamefacedly, I sat. 
The younger of the women sat down on the left [side]; the woman whom I reckoned [to be] the elder, sat down on the right. The younger woman took from her bosom a tobacco-pouch. A tobacco-pouch of silk stuff had she. She had a pipe set about with golden beads. The elder woman had a pipe set about with silver beads. The elder woman sat looking upon me. She drew herself nearer. 
When she spoke, the sound of her words was as the [227] sound of [pieces of] metal clanging: "Child of Rurupa, what hast thou come [here] to do? Thy uncle, a rich man, bred thee up for himself. He was not a true uncle. He took [thy] land for himself. Now he makes saké [on account] of thee. Therefore, knowing of it, I have made thee to come where I [dwell]. Of old, the 'inau' made by thy distant ancestors - I did accept, and [it was] well. 
I therefore, the child of the god of the Middle Hills, - [his] daughter am I. Because if thy uncle should make saké for thee, and slay thee during the drinking [thereof] it were wrong - [therefore] have I brought my younger sister to marry [her] with thee". Thus spoke she, [and] rising took my hand. When she went with me where she lived, in the river [near] her dwelling did she lave me. 
She dried up that little streamlet [with the laving]. She went with me to another streamlet; [and] this little streamlet too did she make dry. When I counted in my mind, six little streamlets did she make dry. From my body a radiance of beams shot forth. Afterwards, when we re-entered [the house], [228] she clad me in raiment of silk, most precious. I was a young man. Joś śere kere! Bidding [me] farewell, she said: 
"Afterwards, when ye shall go, set in order my house, my divine house. In thy turn, thou being a mortal man, if thou shalt [renew and] set in order the 'inaus' of thy forefathers, the things carved out by thy ancestors, thou shalt make 'inaus' as thank-offerings, in payment for thy wife. If thou makest 'inaus', setting the years in order, [it will be] well. Afterwards, when thou goest, and when thou comest to my house, I shall set in order [therein] beautiful heaps of precious things". Having spoken thus, she went out. 
Afterwards, to one extremity of the land, to the edge of the horizon, there went the sound of a true deity disporting [itself]. To the middle of the land there spread the sound of the deity rising up [and] disporting itself. Afterwards we lay down to sleep. On the next day, at dawn, when I looked round, I woke in the house of a god, within [that] house. Piles of precious things [gifts] of the goddess reached to the roof-beams. My wife, a divine woman, was sleeping beside [those] piles. 
[229] When she rose. I rose too. I went out upstream to the bend of a river, [where stood many trees]. I cut an 'inau'. This large 'inau'; calling upon the god of the middle hills, - I made an 'inau'. Making [one] every year, tens of he[-bears] six tens, tens of she[-bears] six tens, did I bring home. I was luckier than any man soever. 
When at last I listened by the sea-shore, my uncle, completely impoverished, had ailed wretchedly, and died. A deity had made him exceeding weak: [so] I heard. Afterwards, having come to my village, I was a rich man, [and] the head of the district, of the district of Rurupa. In my turn I made 'inaus' in the forest. As I made them with gratitude, the swords in my piles [of precious things] clattered ever more noisely, [when] I took them down. 
From another place [there] came two people; when [they] came, they settled and lived [there] quite [for good]. Again from another place two people, three people, having come, settled and lived [there] quite [for good]. Thus doing, they made to themselves a second row of houses at the end of the village. [Men], talking among themselves [said that in] [230] this new row in my village, the village of Rurupa, the people spoke like gods. I was a great rich man, more than any other rich man. I had two children; the daughter did the woman educate; the son did I educate myself. Afterwards [we] died. After [death], when I listened, my children were richer than I had been.
