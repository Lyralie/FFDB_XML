<pb n="17"/>Once the fire went out in all the houses. Only the <animal>snake</animal> had fire. The young girls went to ask him for fire. "If you will become my wives I will give you fire," said he. "No we do not want to," said the girls, "we do not want a <animal>snake</animal> for husband. It will be so difficult to sleep together." Two sisters went also to ask the <animal>snake</animal> for fire. "I'll give you fire if you marry me," replied he. The sisters agreed. The <animal>snake</animal> then gave them rings and returned with the two sisters to their house. The girls told everybody that they had married the <animal>snake</animal>. In the evening they cooked <plant>rice</plant> and ate. When they had eaten they went to sleep. There was still some <plant>rice</plant> left in the saucepan. The <animal>snake</animal> did not eat. <apartmyth><animal>Snakes</animal> do not eat cooked <plant>rice</plant>.</apartmyth> The girls slept at one end of the house, and the <animal>snake</animal> slept at the other end. Once the sisters were fast asleep, the <animal>snake</animal>, who was really a man who wore a <animal>snake</animal> "cloak" (<ref target="g:GEE2143.004">bajo</ref> tal√≤den), took off his <animal>snake</animal> cloak and became a real man. He ate the rest of the <plant>rice</plant> in the saucepan. He smoked tobacco which he took from the girls' tobacco pouches. Then he ate their <plant>betel</plant> nuts. Having finished this he went over to where his two wives were sleeping and lay down between and went to sleep. As it began to get <color>light</color> he got up, put on his <animal>snake</animal> cloak again and went back to his own sleeping place. In the morning the girls said they would finish off the rest of the <plant>rice</plant> from the night before, but when they went to get it, they saw that the saucepan was empty. "Who has eaten the <plant>rice</plant>?" the older sister asked the younger. "l do not know, I was fast asleep all night," she replied. During the day the other girls in the settlement - those who had refused to marry the <animal>snake</animal> - came to have a look. They thought that the <animal>snake</animal> would have gobbled up his two wives.
In the evening the girls cooked <plant>rice</plant> which they ate. There was still quite a lot left in the saucepan when they had finished. Then they went to sleep. When the <animal>snake</animal> saw that they were fast asleep, he took off his <animal>snake</animal> cloak as he had done the night before, ate up the rest of the <plant>rice</plant>, smoked tobacco, ate <plant>betel</plant> nuts, and then lay down to sleep between his two wives. Before sunrise he got up, put his <animal>snake</animal> cloak back on and returned to his own sleeping quarters. In the morning the girls wanted to eat the rest of the <plant>rice</plant>, but found that there was nothing left. During the day the other people in the settlement came to have a look to see if they were still alive or whether the <animal>snake</animal> had swallowed them. But the girls assured everybody that there was no problem in being the <animal>snake</animal>'s wives.
The same thing went on for several nights, and finally the girls decided to find out who it was who was eating their <plant>rice</plant>, smoking their tobacco and eating their <plant>betel</plant> nuts. They went into the jungle and found some nuts that looks very much like <plant>betel</plant>, but are poisonous. Then they picked some leaves that look like <ref target="g:GEE2143.038">sireh</ref> leaves, but are very bitter, and with these they replaced their real <plant>betel</plant> nuts and <ref target="g:GEE2143.038">sireh</ref> leaves. In the evening after they had eaten, they pretended to go to sleep. The <animal>snake</animal> thought that they were asleep and took off his <animal>snake</animal> cloak and went to eat the <plant>rice</plant>. The girls got up and took his <animal>snake</animal> cloak and crumpled it up between <pb n="18"/>their fingers. Then they went back, pretending to be asleep. When the <animal>snake</animal>-man ate the '<plant>betel</plant>-nuts' and the '<ref target="g:GEE2143.038">sireh</ref> leaves' he shouted "This tastes horrible." The girls got up and when he saw them he looked everywhere for his <animal>snake</animal> cloak. "Where is my cloak? Where is my shirt? My original cloak!" he cried. His wives told him that they had destroyed it because they wanted a real husband. They then gave him a real cloak (<ref target="g:GEE2143.004">bajo</ref>) to wear and from then on the <animal>snake</animal>-man was a real man.
The next day all the young girls came to have a look at the <animal>snake</animal> husband. When they saw the handsome man, they became very ashamed because they had refused to marry him.
