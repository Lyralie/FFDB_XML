[There] was also a village; [it] was also a village with an Empty-House-Devil. The people of that house lived in winter in a special winter village within the forest. [But] in summer [this] house was empty. In this house there lived an Empty-House-Devil. [One day there] were two sledges [carrying two men], sledges coming from the forest, [they] went <pb n="104"/>together from a winter village to summer houses. In another village were the people who carried; two sledges were. 
Then those sledge [driving people] returned, [they] had a great load. Not [yet] arriving in that village, it was [already] dark. Losing [their] way, they came to the court of that house. [When] the leading sledge [was] beyond the house, the following sledge being a little farther from the doorway, [there] was [heard] the noise of a man going out of the house. When [they] looked, a man or what? Or devil ... came out. 
[He] seized the arched end of the second sledge and brought [it] to a standstill. Although the man cried out to the dogs, [and] those dogs stretching out their necks pulled, the sledge could not move at all. The devil brought the sledge to a complete standstill. Therefore the following man cried towards the leading sledge: "the old woman of the hut, or the old man of the hut, wishing to force [me] to pay him a visit, has now made me quite motionless. 
'What can I do, perhaps I shall not go [on]. Thus being, <pb n="105"/>I will pay a visit [here]", so said [he]. The man in front answered: '"as for me, I shall not pay a visit, thou alone, if thou likest to enter, go in visiting, all right". Having said so, [he] went on [his way]; to tell about the danger did [he] go. 
Thereupon the following man said to that devil: "Well, because thou wishest to force me to pay thee a visit, thou hast done this, entering quickly, thou wilt perhaps kindle a fire; afterwards I [also] shall enter"; so said [he]. The devil went in. That man cried out to the leading dog, directed [it] towards the wooden rail [to which] dogs [are tied up and] having got up, [he] attached the sledge; after [this he] opened the door [and] entered [the house]. At the same time the devil killed this man. Thereupon [he] went out and killed the two first dogs. 
Now the man in front having arrived at the Ainu village was surrounded by the people wishing to hear the news, and told them [about] the incident. Therefore those men went to see. When they went down to the summer houses, [they] saw that the man had been evidently [already] killed long ago. After [they saw that] all the dogs were quite dead. Then <pb n="106"/>they saw that only the latter part of the harnessed dogs [remained alive]. 
When spring was near the people reflected: "if the devil - things being so - keeps slaying [men] till the end of the world, will not the [dead] men be angry?". Therefore [they] sought for mighty Shamans: three Shamans. The masters of the house, including the children, all were taken out. The Shamans [only], the three Shamans were in that house. After [this they] asked for two brave men, stout-hearted men to warm the drum. 
Inside [the house] to the right was an old Shaman, a great Shaman. In the background [also] was a Shaman. To the left was a little Shaman, a young Shaman. Between the three Shamans [they] seated common folk. Although [they] were in a strange place, they [did not wish] damage, and laid the firewood along the back-wall. The devil was on the right side of the hut near the corner. The devil was quite to be seen. 
Having felt the spirits ot the Shamans, [he] drew together <pb n="107"/>[lots of] different rubbish and put [it] over himself; like great clouds of sand [in a storm] he put [it] over himself. Now the sun went down. [There] were prepared the sacred things of the Shamans. Around the seats [they had] made several little fires of fir-boughs. When the drum [in the hands of the Shamans] sounded loud, [they] put out the fires. Thereupon those three Shamans made their performance. The devil imitating [them] also cried out as a Shaman, [and] put over himself different rubbish. Taking some shoes in tatters [he] struck them together 
When the three Shamans continued their performance, the gods [helping the Shamans] came together, and [there] resounded above the house as it were a noise of wind. And after that, through the smoke-hole [there] entered a god[-sent] arrow. [It] whistled, [the gods] were shooting at that devil. When the people looked, [he] clapped before him with the shoes in tatters [and] kept [it] back. That [god-sent] arrow came against him, and he stopped [it]. When the people looked, the arrow [sent by] the gods had stuck in those tattered shoes. 
Thereupon that devil's laughing voice was [heard] thus: <pb n="108"/>"ihahaha-hahai, shoot the tattered shoes, ihahaha-hahai!"; [he] laughed very [much]. Again the Shamans were very angry. Again they earnestly continued the Shaman performance. Again [there] entered by the hole [above the hearth] a god[-sent] arrow with a whistling [sound]. When the people looked: in a wooden bowl broken in halves [which he] held clapping before himself - [he clapped] towards the arrow [sent by] the gods - this god[-sent] arrow shot, hit the one half of the wooden bowl: [and there] the god[-sent] arrow stuck. 
Thereupon that devil's laughing voice was [heard] thus: "ihahaha! they have hit a broken wooden bowl! ihahaha!" he laughed very [much]. Sleepless sat the people. Again a god[-sent] arrow entered. That devil held [two] fragments of a birch-bark-vessel, clapping [them] before him in the direction of the god[-sent] arrow. That god[-sent] arrow came against the birch-bark fragments, and that, god[-sent] arrow stuck in the birch-bark fragments. 
That devil laughed: "ihahaha, birch-bark-fragments have been hit; ihahahahai!" [he] laughed very [much]. Thereafter - a little time after, he covered himself [with] the most various <pb n="109"/>pieces of rubbish. The [glare] of his eyes was inside the hut like bits of [glowing] charcoal. Thereafter, just at midnight, the great Shaman's gods - one shaman's [only] - were angered. and [he] could no longer perform the Shaman rites. Now at last, in the face of the little Shaman, [did] the blood [mantle] almost coming forth, [so] angered was he. 
The little Shaman alone performed [the rites] with energy. At last the little Shaman invoked the [helping] gods, [and] having risen, [he] performed the Shaman rites. [He] struck on the drum with a little wooden drumstick, covered with hairy [leather]. As the people were looking on, from this wooden drumstick, [from] the end [thereof] [there] came out a snake. That snake fell down. After, [he] took that snake, and struck with it on the drum. That snake uttered a voice: piśś; so made [it]. Opening its mouth, [it] uttered a voice. 
Thereupon the eyes of that devil protruded and [they] stared without blinking, very staringlv. Thereafter, through the hole [in the roof there] entered a god[-sent] sword, fell on the neck of that devil [and] cut his neck through. [His] head <pb n="110"/>rolled about, again it rose. At the same time through the [house] hole [there] entered a god[-sent] arrow. The arrow stuck in the upper part of the [body], the body quivered all [over]. The body of that devil disappeared in the earth, [there] was to be seen only the trace of the place [by which he entered it]. 
After at day-break [they] called all the people [owners] of the house and showed [it them, there] was only blood flowing along the sleeping bench like a little stream, [but] the body was not [there]. Thereupon [the owners] gave the two Shamans in payment just the fine for the two poor men slain. To the Shaman, whose gods [his patrons] had been angered, [they] gave the usual payment of a Shaman's performance. Thanks to that, the people [will be able] to live without trouble till the end of the world. If [it] were not [for] those two Shamans, [and] if that devil had lived till the end of the world, would [they] not have had [continual] trouble?
