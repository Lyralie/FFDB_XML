<pb n="7"/>The <animal>python</animal> was the wife of the <animal>kori bustard</animal>. The <animal>kori bustard</animal> had married the <animal>python</animal>. The <animal>jackal</animal> was the <animal>python</animal>'s younger sister.
The two sisters went to the waterhole, to the spring, and the <animal>jackal</animal> said to the <animal>python</animal>, "Climb up the tree. Let's eat these <plant latin="Ziziphus mucronata">n«Ça</plant> fruits hanging here." So the <animal>python</animal> climbed the tree, climbed up into the small branches, and the branches broke with her weight. She fell into the spring. Then the <animal>jackal</animal> said "Ha! Now I'll go steal her husband away from her." The <animal>python</animal> was left at the bottom of the spring. She just lay there.
The <animal>jackal</animal> picked up the <animal>python</animal>'s things, her clothing and ornaments, and put them on. She hung them on herself and tried them this way and that. In the late afternoon she returned to the <animal>kori bustard</animal>'s camp. She went home and went to sit in the <animal>python</animal>'s house.
Soon the <animal>python</animal>'s husband came home from the <plant>bush</plant>, "Where's my wife?" he said to himself. "Who is this sitting here instead? Why don't I see my wife today, now that I've come home? Where has my wife gone today? What's happened?" Night began to fall. They all sat around and talked and talked. When it was <color>dark</color>, the <animal>kori bustard</animal> took arrows and stood them up in the sand. He stood them in rows with the tips pointing upwards. When the <animal>jackal</animal> went to bed she lay down on top of them. And so she died. When dawn broke, the husband left and went away. He was changed into a <animal>kori bustard</animal>. And the <animal>jackal</animal> became a <animal>jackal</animal>.
