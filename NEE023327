<pb n="89"/>A man was out hunting with his son Had. The people back at the settlement were preparing payong nuts. The hunters came across a tobowad monkey and the father shot it and it fell dead to the ground. Later he shot two more. Had meanwhile was digging for <plant><ref target="g:GEE2143.040">takkad</ref></plant> tubers. When he saw the dead monkeys he said to his father, "We'll be eating meat with payong this evening." "Watch what you are saying," said the father angrily, "it is tiger <ref target="g:GEE2143.030">punén</ref> to say that one will be eating tobowad monkey together with payong nuts. To say so is to speak badly."<note>This is another form of "speaking badly" and to do so is also <ref target="g:GEE2143.030">punén</ref>. In this case, Had transgressed by expressing his happy anticipation at the imminent meal of monkey and payong, a combination much liked by the Chewong</note> After having warned Had, the father climbed a nearby tree in order to collect some firewood so that they could burn off the monkeys' fur before bringing them home. There was lots of firewood on the ground, but he wanted to collect it from the tree. 
While his father was up in the tree, Had saw something move in the undergrowth. "There is something moving over there!" he shouted to his father who climbed down to have a look. It was in fact a tiger who had come when Had 'spoke badly', but when it saw the father, it moved away. "Maybe it is tiger," said the father. "Oh, no I don't think so," replied Had, and the father climbed up again for some more firewood. The tiger moved closer. "Father, there is something moving around!" shouted Had and the father climbed down again to have a look, but he could see nothing. 
After they had burned the fur off the three monkeys<note>The Chewong always throw a whole animal on the fire in order to burn off its fur, feathers, or skin. This is a gift to the fire in return for all its services. The act is often done in the forest because firewood is more easily available.</note> they set off for home. The father walked in front carrying the three monkeys in his backbasket, and Had followed with the wild tubers in his basket. A bird spoke in the distance. "Maybe that is the tiger coming for you," joked the father. The tiger, however, was following behind Had. They came to a river. The father crossed it first, but when Had was about to do so, the tiger leaped up and bit him at the back of his neck. The father turned round quickly and caught Had as he was falling and the tiger ran away when he saw the father. The father carried Had over his shoulder. The tiger followed the blood trail. They reached another river. Having crossed it, the father hid behind some bushes and waited. Soon the tiger arrived. The father shot ten poisoned darts at it, picked up Had, and ran home. He did not wait to see if the poison would kill the tiger. 
When he reached the settlement, Had's sisters who had been preparing the payong nuts asked what had happened. "Oh, he spoke badly," the father told them, "and the tiger came and bit him." In the evening Had died. A man from the settlement went to look for the tiger, and when he reached the river he found the corpse of the tiger lying there. The poisoned darts had killed him.
