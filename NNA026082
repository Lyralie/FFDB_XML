Beaver and Muskrat lived together in Muskrat's house. One day they had a quarrel; and Beaver, being the stronger and possessed of the better teeth, defeated Muskrat. In the struggle the house was torn down. Beaver now stole the ridge-pole and went off to another place, where he built a good house just like Muskrat's former house. Muskrat went to see him, and asked for his ridge-pole; but Beaver would not give it up. He also would not allow him to live in his house. For this reason muskrats now live in the water and have poor houses, and beavers have good houses.
