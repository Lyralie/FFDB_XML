Now the people in many parts of the country had no food. Game and all kinds of food were in the possession of a few persons [or families], who alone controlled these things. Thus many people were constantly starving. Raven followed the shores of the ocean in his canoe. As he went along, he noticed many things underneath the water which the people could eat; but, owing to the depth of the water, this food was out of reach. At last he came to a large man sitting down on the edge of the water. He asked him why he was sitting there; and the man answered, "If I get up, the ocean will dry up." It seems, he was sitting on a hole in the earth through which the water poured when he arose. Raven told him to get up, but he would not do so. Then Raven took him by the hair, and pulled him up so far that he was able to put a rock underneath him. The rock was sharp; and when the man sat down again, it hurt him, and he jumped up farther. Raven then put a larger sharp-pointed rock under hum. Thus he continued until the man was sitting almost upright. The ocean went down a long way, and exposed the beach. Raven said to the man,: "Henceforth you must get up twice a day, and let the sea go down as far as it is now, so that people may obtain food from the beach. Then you will sit down again to let the water gather and come up. If you promise to do this, I shall not kill you." At last the man promised, and thus the tides were made. The people were able to find many kinds of food in abundance along the shore, and they no longer starved.<note>According to another version, said to be of Tlingit origin, he called the Tide-Man his partner. He pushed him over unawares, and struck his backside with devil's clubs. When the Tide-Man tried to sit on the hole again, the devil's club hurt him so much that he had to rise again. Then the sea began to ebb and to rise.</note>
