Xwā′xwas was the ancestor of the G·ī′g·ilgam. When the Deluge came, he assumed the form of a salmon and went into the lake at the foot of the mountain Xa′wolē, at the upper part of Nimkish Lake. When the Deluge subsided, he landed at Flat Place [Ōdzâ′ᵋlîs]. There he lived all by himself. After some time, Kunō′ᵋsila came down in the form of the thunder-bird and joined him. Xwā′xwas built a house. He prepared the posts and put them up, and then he made the beams, but he did not know how to raise them. Kunō′ᵋsila took them up in his talons and placed them on top of the beams. The name of Xwā′xwas's house was Only-House-on-Prairie [ᵋnᴇ′msgᴇmdzâ′ᵋlas]. In front of his house is a rock which was called Thunder-Bird Place [Ku′nᵋwas]. This is the place where Kunō′ᵋsila used to have his salmon-trap, and where he caught birds in snares. 
After some time Xwā′xwas became sick. He had a sore [a′mtaᵋ], which increased in size, and which could <pb n="472"/>not be cured. Finally he died. This disease was inherited in his family, so that it finally became their crest. All the members of his family are liable to die of the same disease.
