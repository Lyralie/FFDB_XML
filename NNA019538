Xwāʹxwas was the ancestor of the G·īʹg·ilgam. When the Deluge came, he assumed the form of a salmon and went into the lake at the foot of the mountain Xaʹwolē, at the upper part of Nimkish Lake. When the Deluge subsided, he landed at Flat Place [Ōdzâʹᵋlîs]. There he lived all by himself. After some time, Kunōʹᵋsila came down in the form of the thunder-bird and joined him. Xwāʹxwas built a house. He prepared the posts and put them up, and then he made the beams, but he did not know how to raise them. Kunōʹᵋsila took them up in his talons and placed them on top of the beams. The name of Xwāʹxwas's house was Only-House-on-Prairie [ᵋnᴇʹmsgᴇmdzâʹᵋlas]. In front of his house is a rock which was called Thunder-Bird Place [Kuʹnᵋwas]. This is the place where Kunōʹᵋsila used to have his salmon-trap, and where he caught birds in snares. 
After some time Xwāʹxwas became sick. He had a sore [aʹmtaᵋ], which increased in size, and which could <pb n="472"/>not be cured. Finally he died. This disease was inherited in his family, so that it finally became their crest. All the members of his family are liable to die of the same disease.
