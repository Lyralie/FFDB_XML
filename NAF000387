ǀχábbi-aŋ<note>The narrator's mother.</note> killed [my] leveret for me, and I came crying to her, because I wanted them<note>i.e. his mother and his maternal grandmother ǂkammì.</note> therefore to seek for [other] leverets; for they were those who had killed [my] leveret for me. And she soothed <pb n="319"/>me, about it. Therefore, she told me that the lizard had formerly said:

Tsātsi<note>The narrator's maternal grandfather.</note> was the one who caught hold of [and] took up a leveret on the hunting-ground; and, he brought it [home] alive, he came [and] gave it to me. And I played with it; I set it down, it ran; I also ran after it. And I went to catch it, and, I came to set it down. It again ran; and I again ran to catch it; and I went catching hold of it, I came to set it down. Again, it ran; and, I again ran after it. And I again caught hold of it; and again, I caught hold of it; and I came to set it down. 
ǀχábbi-aŋ wished that I [should] leave off playing with the leveret, that I [should] kill it, that I [should] lay it to roast. I was not willing to kill the leveret. She wished me to leave off playing with the leveret, that I [should] kill it, that I might lay it to roast. I was not willing to kill the leveret, because I felt that nothing acted as prettily as it did, when it was gently running, gently running along. It did in this manner [showing the motion of its ears], while it was gently running along, nothing acted as prettily as it did; and it went to sit down. 
<pb n="321"/>Then they told me to fetch water; for I was one who quickly came away from the water, while I did not go to play at the water. Therefore, I went to fetch water, when I had tied up the leveret. And I went to fetch water; then, they killed [my] leveret for me, while I was at the water. They killed [my] leveret for me; and then I came [and] cried, about it; because I had thought that they would let [my] leveret alone. For, they must have been deceiving me; they told me to fetch water, while they must have intended that they would kill [my] leveret for me, which I had meant to let alone, so that it might live [on] in peace. They had killed it for me. Therefore, I came [and] cried, on account of it. They said, that we should not again get another leveret; when I wanted them to seek some leverets for me, they said, we should not again get another leveret.
Therefore, they soothing calmed [?] me with the [story of the] lizard; while they wished that I might quietly listen to them; when I had shut my mouth, I might quietly listen to them.<note>She [my mother] said [to me], that I should not play with meat; for we do not play with meat; for we lay meat to roast. For the leveret is not a little fat; therefore, we kill it, we lay it to roast, while we do not play with it.</note>
