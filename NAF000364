<pb n="101"/>The [son of the] Wind was formerly still. And he rolled<note>Rolled [a ball of] ǁkụárrì to him. I think that it must have been ǁkụárrì; for, ǁkuárrì is that with which we are rolling [a ball]: when we wish to aim, seeing ourselves, whether a man aims better than the other people. Therefore, we are rolling [a ball] with ǁkụárrì. ǁkụárrì is found in our country. They stand in numbers around. Therefore, the porcupine eats them. We do not eat them; for they are poison.</note> [a ball] to ǃnā-ka-tĭ̍. He exclaimed: "O ǃnā-ka-tĭ̍! There it goes!" And ǃnā-ka-tĭ̍ exclaimed: "O comrade! There it goes!" because ǃnā-ka-tí felt that he did not know his [the other one's] name. Therefore, ǃnā-ka-tĭ̍ said: "O comrade! There it goes!" He who was the wind, he was the one who said: "O ǃnā-ka-tĭ̍! There it goes!"
Therefore, ǃnā-ka-tĭ<note>The name ǃná-ka-tĭ ǀhaŋǂkassʼō was unable to explain. He thinks that it must have been given by the parents, as ǃná-ka-tĭ was still a child. He further stated that the word ǃnā is the name of an insect which resembles the locust. It is large, and also resembles the Acridium ruficorne. It is red. It affects the eyes of the Bushmen. Their eyes become closed and they writhe with pain on account of the burning caused by this insect.</note> went to question his mother about the other one's name. He exclaimed: "O our mother! Utter for me comrade who is yonder, his name; for, comrade utters my name; I do not utter comrade's name. I would also utter comrade's name, when I am rolling [the ball] to him. For, I do not utter comrade's name; I would also utter his name, when I roll [the ball] to him." Therefore, <pb n="103"/>his mother exclaimed: "I will not utter to thee comrade's name. For, thou shalt wait; that father may first shelter for us the hut;<note>They had a hut ... the hut was small. They probably had a mat hut.</note> that father may first strongly shelter the hut.<note>That is, make a strong screen of bushes for the mat hut.</note> And then I will utter for thee comrade's name. And thou shalt, when I have uttered for thee comrade's name, thou must, when I am the one who has uttered for thee comrade's name, thou must, when I have uttered for thee comrade's name, thou must scamper away, thou must run home, that thou mayest come into the hut, whilst thou dost feel that the wind would blow thee away."
Therefore, the child went; they [the two children] went to roll [the ball] there. Therefore, he [ǃnā-ka-tĭ̍] again, he went to his mother, he again, he went to question his mother about the other one's name.
And his mother exclaimed: "ǀérritẹn-ǃkụaŋ-ǃkụaŋ" it is; ǃgáŭ-ǃgáubu-tĭ̍ it is. He is ǀérritẹn-ǃkụaŋ-ǃkụaŋ; he is ǃgáŭ-ǃgáubu-tĭ̍, he is ǀérritẹn-ǃkụaŋ-ǃkụaŋ."
Therefore, ǃná-ka-tĭ̍ went on account of it. He went to roll [the ball] there, while he did not utter the other one's name, while he felt that his mother was the one who had thus spoken to him. She said: "Thou must not, at first, utter comrade's name. Thou must, at first, be silent, even if comrade be the one who is uttering thy name. Therefore, thou shalt, when thou hast uttered comrade's name, thou must run home, while thou dost feel that the wind would blow thee away."
Therefore, ǃná-ka-tĭ̍ went on account of it; they went to roll [the ball] there, while the other was <pb n="105"/>the one who uttered his [ǃná-ka-tĭ̍'s] name. While he [ǃná-ka-tĭ̍] felt that he wished that his father should first finish making the shelter for the hut. And [when] he saw that his father sat down, then he would, afterwards, utter the other one's name, when he beheld that his father had finished sheltering the hut.
Therefore, when he beheld that his father had finished sheltering the hut, then he exclaimed: "There it goes! O ǀérritẹn-ǃkụaŋ-ǃkụaŋ! There it goes ǃgáŭ-ǃgáŭbu-tĭ̍! There it goes! And he scampered away, he ran home; while the other one began to lean over, and the other one fell down. He lay kicking violently upon the vlei.<note>A depression in the ground, sometimes dry, sometimes covered with coarse grass and rushes, and sometimes filled with water.</note> Therefore, the people's huts vanished away, the wind blew, breaking their [sheltering] bushes, together with the huts, while the people could not see for the dust. Therefore, his [the wind's] mother came out of the hut<note>Her hut remained standing, while it felt that they themselves were wind.</note> [i.e., of the wind's hut]; his mother came, grasping [him], to raise him up; his mother, grasping [him], set him on his feet. And he was unwilling, [and] wanted to lie still. His mother, taking hold [of him], set him on his feet. Therefore, the wind became still; while the wind had, at first, while he lay, caused the dust to rise.
Therefore, we who are Bushmen, we are wont to say: "The wind seems to be lying down, for, it does not gently blow [i.e. it blows strongly]. For, when it stands [upright], then it is still, when it stands; for, it seems to be lying down, when it <pb n="107"/>does in this manner. its knee is that which makes a noise, when it lies down; for its knee does sound. I had wished that it might gently blow for us, that we might go out, that we might ascend the place yonder, that we might behold the river bed yonder standing behind [the hill]. For, we have driven away the springbok from this place. Therefore, the springbok, have gone to yonder [dry] river bed standing behind [the hill]. For, we have not a little shot the springbok at this place; for, we have shot, letting the sun set,<note>Literally, "having put in the sun."</note>  at the springbok at this place."
