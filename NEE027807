In Taraika six rich men lived. One rich man went up to the Oroks, [where] there was an Orok's house; the reindeer were many. This rich man entered an Orok's house [and] sat near the fire. The Oroks gave as food to that rich man the stomach of reindeer smeared with reindeer dung. This rich man took offence and did not eat. Thereupon [he] <pb n="67"/>went down home to Taraika and told [the offence] to the five rich men [who] remained at home.
Thereupon [they] all went up to the house of this Orok with [their] comrades, killed the Oroks, [and] also killed all the women. One young male Orok, this alone ran away; among reindeer running [he] mounted a reindeer; having mounted ran away [and] escaped. To Unei [he] ran away [and] escaped. Having gone there, [he] related [what had happened]. Thereupon afterwards the Oroks made also many bows, [they] made also many arrows. 
Thereupon, afterwards presently winter came. In Tarankotan were many people fishing with lines. Thereupon suddenly from the lake of Tarankotan plenty of these reindeer came down. The Oroks sat upon the reindeers; on [their] backs [they] had quivers [with] arrows put in fully. [They] came down near to the Ainus. The Ainus then did not know anything [and] fished with lines. These Oroks shot with bows at the people fishing with lines through the ice [holes] in the river. [They] killed all these Ainus. 
<pb n="68"/>One Ainu only - [he] had nothing in his hand - went running towards Taraika. The reindeer also went running, although [they] did not overtake this Ainu. Just in the midst, [between] Tarankotan and the mouth of the river of Taraika, there was the grave of a dead man; was a tomb. [He] opened the roof [and] took the bone bow [which] the people [had formerly] thrown [inside to the] dead man, strung the cord; there were two arrows [also] and having put an arrow on [to] the bow, [he awaited] the reindeer [which] were coming after [him] and stood in readiness for the Oroks. 
Now the Oroks came near. He bent the bow against [them], the cord of the bow broke, he could do nothing, to do anything was impossible. After that the Oroks shot with bows [and] then killed [him]. This being so, [they] came to [the village of] Siska. Now it was dark. [It] being [already] dark - now in Siska the people lived in earth-houses - these Oroks came to the yards of the earth-houses, took much grass, set fire [to it] [and] threw [it inside] through the holes of the earth-houses. 
[They] put into the earth-houses much burning grass <pb n="69"/>[and] certainly the inside of the earth-houses burnt violently; [they] tore off the covering of the chimneys, [and] also set fire to the holes of the chimneys; [they] also put in the burning grass through the doors. [With] all this village [they] did so. [They] killed all the Ainus, not one was [left]. These Oroks went to the [village of] Taraika. 
In Taraika six rich men put on cuirasses also, and day and night kept watch. Thereupon the Oroks went, having seen the Ainus, the rich men looking so dressed; [and] having taken fright went [away], passing across the lake; went [away] quite. At [the village of] Nokoro also thev made war in such manner. Doing thus they went [along the shore] from this sea [i. e. the Bay of Patience]; quite till [they] reached Karer. The Ainus lived in earth-houses; [they] set fire to the grass, put [it] in through the holes, [and] burned down all the houses. 
After that [they] seized goodly women, led them to [their own] lands. The Oroks married [them], made wives [of them], [and] had children by them. The Oroks seized the women of <pb n="70"/>the Karer Ainus in the war [and] had children bv them, therefore the Ainus are the kinsmen [of] the Oroks. Now warring [is] finished. After this, although the Ainus are also angered [against] the Oroks, the former cannot make war. If the Oroks will be insolent to the Ainus in such [case] the Ainus also will have an angry heart. 
If the Oroks like to fight the first, then the [Ainu] people will fight with pleasure. But the [Ainu] people will not fight first. After this, in Taraika two men learned to fight; [one] drew the bow, [and] one man stood at a distance; thereafter plenty of people all stood together; all the people carrying bows, laid [blunt] wooden arrows first upon the bows; when [they] had put [the arrows] on the bows - one man staying at some distance - all the people shot at that man with [blunt] wooden arrows. 
He dodged away [from] all the arrows, at the same time [he] seized [them] all with [his] hands, [he] seized many of these arrows; [he] made [that] not one arrow hit him. [That] being so, previously the people practised with [blunt] wooden <pb n="71"/>arrows, [and] not one of these people hit [that] man: - because it was so, now if all the people shoot at once with real iron arrows, [and] if the people miss also, now at last [it] will be well. Now, shot from the bows, these numerous arrows, all [directed] towards the man; - these numerous arrows when they flew at him [he] dodged away from them: at the same time [he] seized [them] all; not one arrow did [he] allow to hit him. 
This being so - another man - did the people - as they had done formerly, there being plenty of men on one side and again one man alone being on the other, - shoot at this man with arrows; although all those men shot, [they] could not [hit him]. Now in Taraika there were two men very able in [such] amusements. Now therefore the Oroks made war with the Ainus; [and] now those two Ainus being so able in the sports - the other Ainus also were possessed with sense of strength. Now, even though the Oroks should fight, the Ainus also would not have a terrified heart. If the Oroks would first [begin] the war, the Ainus also with pleasure [are] <pb n="72"/>awaiting the war. Although [they] await till to-day that the Oroks [shall] make war first, [still these] could not. Formerly the Ainus did evil to the Oroks, therefore the Ainus let them win. [That] being so, the Ainus cannot fight first.
