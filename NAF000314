<pb n="8"/><anamyth>This is the story of <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> and the <animal>jackal</animal>.</anamyth> The <animal>jackal</animal> was the younger sister and <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> was her older sister. One day the <animal>jackal</animal> came to her sister and said "let's go pick <plant>nǂa</plant>. You can reach the branch with the berries and hand them down to me." But <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> said, "no, that branch lies out over the water, and I'm afraid of it." The <animal>jackal</animal> insisted: "Oh, come on, let's go pick some. You can reach the <plant>nǂa</plant> branch and pull it down." <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> replied, "If I pull that branch down it's sure to flip me into the water. Now just stop talking about eating <plant>nǂa</plant>." But the <animal>jackal</animal> said, "If you start to fall in I'll catch you. If you lose your grip and start to slide in, if it looks like you're going into the water, I'll be there to jump and grab you. Come on, don't just sit there - let's go eat <plant>nǂa</plant>."
So they walked and walked until they came to the water. <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> jumped and grabbed the <plant>nǂa</plant> branch. All the while she was muttering to herself, "What in the world am I doing here pulling down this dangerous branch? Why do I listen to this deceitful sister of mine?" Then suddenly she lost her grip and - ǃKom! she fell into the water. She fell right into the water. It was a deep spring and a wide one, and it was full to the brim with water. When she fell, the <animal>jackal</animal> pretended to try and catch her, but let her fall between her arms.
Now beside the spring was a pile of clothing and ornaments that <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> had taken off before she tried to reach the <plant>nǂa</plant>. She had stood beside the <plant>tree</plant> and peeled off her things, left <pb n="9"/>them lying inside out. When her sister was out of the way, the <animal>jackal</animal> ran up to the pile in glee. She began putting on the clothes. But she put them on inside out! Finally she put her sister's hat on her head and marched off.
She walked back to the camp. There she met her brother-in-law, her sister's husband. He said, "What have you done with my wife? Where have you left her?" and looked long and hard at his sister-in-law the <animal>jackal</animal>. The <animal>jackal</animal> said, "Well, um, it's like this. Um, we, well, we, um, I took my sister and we went picking <plant>nǂa</plant> and she fell to the bottom of the spring." <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName>'s husband said, "Koo-oo-oo! Are you standing there and telling me you took my wife and the two of you went off and she fell into the well?"
By this time the sun was going down. At sunset the <animal>jackal</animal> sat visiting with some other young girls who were there. They were all telling stories. The <animal>jackal</animal> laughed harshly. "ǁaǁa, ǁˮa!" Then she covered her mouth and said, "Yo! Why am I laughing like a <animal>jackal</animal> today? What's happened to me that I should laugh like a <animal>jackal</animal>?" Her brother-in-law <animal>kori bustard</animal> said, "Oh, go screw yourself: you are a <animal>jackal</animal>, you fool. It was my wife who was beautiful <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName>, and you are only a <animal>jackal</animal>."
But the <animal>jackal</animal> kept up the pretense, and walked proudly away from him. She tried to undulate gracefully like <persName>ǃXõǁəmdima</persName> did. She wanted to glide away with regal steps and sit down smoothly as her sister did. But all she could manage was a <pb n="10"/>bounce. "Yo! Why am I walking like a <animal>jackal</animal>?" she exclaimed.
"Oh, screw yourself!" yelled the <animal>kori bustard</animal>. "How come you've always been a <animal>jackal</animal> and now suddenly stop being one?" And he stomped off to bed early. He took all the <animal>jackal</animal>'s sleeping skins and spread them out, with his, on the sand. Later the <animal>jackal</animal> decided to go to sleep. Now the <animal>kori bustard</animal> had taken long arrows, those bone arrows that the hunters poison, and stuck them into the sand beneath her blankets. He stuck rows and rows of them into the sand where she was going to sleep. The <animal>jackal</animal> began to settle herself among the skins. "Xi!" an arrow stuck her. "Yo!" she said. "What kind of crummy places do you choose to sleep in, anyway? It's all thorny here!" But the <animal>kori bustard</animal> replied, "Koo, won't you just go to sleep quietly? What's the matter with you? This is where I always spread out our blankets. If you're really my wife, you ought to know that." So they slept. But the <animal>jackal</animal> wasn't sleeping, because she was already dead. The poison had killed her.
In the morning when dawn broke, the <animal>jackal</animal>'s grandmother sent her littlest granddaughter to see why the <animal>jackal</animal> did not get up. "Go get her up. Wake up your sister. What's she doing sleeping so late?" The little girl went to see what was the matter. "Koo-oo-oo!" she cried. "As sure as all of us stand here, <plant>nǂa</plant> seeds have dried last night in her asshole-asshole. She has died and her faeces have stuck in her anus! She died last night, and her faeces are stuck halfway out her anus. That's what has happened." When the little girl said this, <pb n="11"/>her grandmother said, "Yo, what did you say? What's happened to the <animal>jackal</animal>?" "Grannie!" shouted the child a little louder. "<plant>Nǂa</plant> seeds have dried in older sister's asshole-asshole! Didn't you hear me?" But the grandmother couldn't understand her. Finally the little girl told her to come and see for herself.
She came and saw that her granddaughter had died in the night. "Koo-oo!" she said. "What happened to her, what has killed her?" Then she broke off the faeces that had dried in the <animal>jackal</animal>'s anus, and she ate it. Her other granddaughter said, "Give me some, grannie, give me some too!" So they ate it all up. Then they picked the <animal>jackal</animal>'s body up and laid it out flat. They slit her stomach open. Then they brought fire wood and dug a trench to put it in. The old woman walked to and fro bringing wood, and as she worked, the fire burnt itself down to coals. The old woman roasted the <animal>jackal</animal>; she roasted her granddaughter. The sun passed overhead and at last she went to take her out of the fire. She knocked the ashes off her with a stick. Then she cut the body open and separated the different parts. She and her little granddaughter began to eat. They ate and ate.
