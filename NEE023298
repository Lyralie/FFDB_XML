<pb n="6"/>People make this world, Earth Seven, very dirty (<ref target="g:GEE2143.019">kama</ref>) by their behaviour. They hunt and kill animals and shed their blood, they urinate and defecate. These acts make Earth Seven very dirty and very hot. This is why the <ref target="g:GEE2143.009">bi asal</ref> do not wish to visit us here, it is dirty and too hot. When we have shed much blood, and we urinated and defecated a great deal, then Tohan does not want this earth to continue any longer. He wants to make a new one. So he tells all the jungle people (bi brete) that he will turn Earth Seven upside down. When they hear this, the jungle people are turned into blossom and they all fly up to Earth Six where they live from then on. Tohan then turns the Earth upside down and everybody drowns. The underside of Earth Seven then becomes the new earth. It is completely flat, so Tohan draws valleys and rivers on it, and he plants fruit trees. New People are made. 
Tohan did this before, a long time ago, and he will do it again when he thinks it has become too dirty here.
