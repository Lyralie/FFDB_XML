<pb n="3"/>In the old, old days people did not know about <ref target="g:GEE2143.023">maro</ref><note><ref target="g:GEE2143.023">Maro</ref> and <ref target="g:GEE2143.028">pantang</ref> (see below) are both rules governing Chewong behaviour. <ref target="g:GEE2143.023">Maro</ref> specifies that one must always share one's food and offer visitors to eat. <ref target="g:GEE2143.028">pantang</ref> rules are about specified behaviour at times of life crises. (See also part IV).</note> [the rule that specifies that one may not eat alone, but always be generous and share one's food]. One day <persName>Bujægen Yed</persName><note><persName>Bujægen</persName> is derived from the Malay bujang which means single, unmarried. The Chewong use it to indicate a young man, usually, but not necessarily, a bachelor. Yed is a species of <animal>lizard</animal>.</note> went hunting. He shot a <animal latin="Arctictis">binturong</animal>.<note>The <animal latin="Arctictis">binturong (Arctictis)</animal> is a member of the Malayan <animal>civet</animal> family. It is primarily arboreal and it is omnivorous (Medway 1978).</note> He prepared it and cooked it in the jungle on his own. In those days people lived by the maxim "whatever I catch I eat, whatever you catch you eat." That was how it was in the old days. While <persName>Bujægen Yed</persName> was eating his catch of the day, <persName>Yinlugen Bud</persName><note>Yinlugen is the aspect of a person that continues to live in the afterworld; also a class of (usually) harmful superhuman beings. Bud means a fallen treetrunk.</note> came by. He is an original ghost who was around before the first humans. <persName>Bud</persName> asked <persName>Yed</persName> what he was doing. "I am eating my <animal>binturong</animal>," replied <persName>Yed</persName>. "If you eat alone and don't share, you <ref target="g:GEE2143.023">maro</ref>. You must always share your food with others. Human beings must never eat alone," <persName>Bud</persName> told him. When he heard this, <persName>Yed</persName> took his <animal>binturong</animal> meat and went home. He gave the meat to his wife who was pregnant. She ate and was no longer hungry. She was about to give birth. She had bad pains in her stomach. <persName>Yed</persName> took out his knife and prepared to cut open her stomach. <persName>Yinlugen Bud</persName> who had followed <persName>Yed</persName> back to his house asked him what he was doing. "l am going to cut open my wife's stomach so that the child can get out," said <persName>Yed</persName>. "No, no," said <persName>Bud</persName> "Don't do that. There is an opening." He showed <persName>Yed</persName> how to press on the stomach of the pregnant woman, and when the baby came out, <persName>Bud</persName> showed <persName>Yed</persName> how to cut the navel string with a piece of <plant>bamboo</plant> and tie it with a piece of <plant>rattan</plant>. Then he showed him how to wrap the afterbirth in leaves and place it in a <plant>tree</plant>, and how to cover the blood with ashes. <persName>Yed</persName> then started to feed the child from his elbow, which was how the men used to feed their babies after their wives had died from having their stomach cut open. "What are you doing?" asked <persName>Bud</persName>, "there is milk in the mother's breasts." Then <persName>Bud</persName> taught the birth spells, and the various leaves to be used for medicines after the birth.
He showed him which species of <plant>tree</plant> fibres to boil and give the mother to drink, and which leaves to warm up and put on her stomach. He also told him all the <ref target="g:GEE2143.028">pantang</ref> rules connected with child birth: the woman sleeps next to the fire, she cannot go out except to relieve herself, nor can she eat meat until all bleeding has ceased. Having taught <persName>Yed</persName> all practices connected with child birth, <persName>Yinlugen Bud</persName> returned to his own lands. <epimyth>From then on women did not die in child birth, and people did not eat alone any more, but always brought back their game and shared it with everybody.</epimyth>
