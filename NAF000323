Once <persName>Kauha</persName>'s wives were <plant>ǂnǂdwa bushes</plant>. They were doing what women do, but they were <plant>ǂnǂdwa bushes</plant>. They were looking for a way to get back at their husband. When he happened to come near the <plant>ǂnǂdwa</plant> patch, the <plant>bushes</plant> jumped on him and beat him. They pounded him and hit him over the head. He had just been walking along and suddenly the <plant>bushes</plant> were cracking his head open.
<persName>Kauha</persName> finally got the <plant>bushes</plant> quieted down, and he stood them back up in the sand so that they were just regular <plant>ǂnǂdwa</plant> again. Then he went into the center of the patch, "Here is a lot of ripe <plant>ǂnǂdwa</plant>!" he called out to his wives. "Come on and eat it with me!" When the wives came running and had come into the midst of the <plant>bushes</plant>, he made the <plant>bushes</plant> begin to beat them. The <plant>ǂnǂdwa</plant> beat them until they cried and ran away.
