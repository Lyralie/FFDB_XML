<note>This fragment seems to include material from two different sources, - one belonging to the Raven cycle, and probably borrowed from the Chukchee; the other referring to the creation of Uñiʼsak and Alaska, undoubtedly Eskimo.</note>
The Raven and his wife created the world. They made the cape of Uñi'sak out of a nose of an eider-duck [Somatheria spectabilis]; the peninsula of Alaska, of a long belt-knife; and the island Imaʼlik [one of the Diomedes], of a button of the scabbard [with which it is clasped around the hip]. They made reindeer of their hair, and dogs of their nails, and sea-water of their urine.
