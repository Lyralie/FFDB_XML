<anamyth>Even people were different in the beginning. We were definitely not like people. We were like <animal>animals</animal>; we were made the same way <animal>animals</animal> were made. <animal>Animals</animal> were created just like people were.</anamyth>
When <persName>Kauha</persName> was on the earth, when <persName>ǃGara</persName> first came to the earth, he wanted to sleep with his wife but didn't know how. He tried sticking his penis up her nose, he tried putting it into her ears. He did it this way for awhile until people told him, "Don't you know you're supposed to do it this way?"
One day <persName>Kauha</persName> was sitting with his wife and he caught a glimpse of her crotch. He stared and stared at it and wondered, "What's that? What can that be?" The others told him, "That's something for you to eat." So <persName>Kauha</persName> listened to their advice and he took his wife the right way.
She gave birth, and <persName>ǃGara</persName> had children. They slept together and slept together and had a lot of children. Then they all came out of their hole in the ground in which they lived. "Yes," people said to him, "This is how you take a woman."
From there he went on to create things. He began to go about making things and giving them names. He named his two sons <persName>Kanǁa</persName> and <persName>ǃXoma</persName>. Then he made all the other people. <epimyth>At first we were not people but were something else.</epimyth>
