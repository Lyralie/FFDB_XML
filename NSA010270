<pb n="19"/>A long time ago all the kéšpix of the [then so-called] human beings who died here in our country went far away to Šamaxáni.<note>The Yamana give this name to a very remote region which they neither know nor describe more precisely.</note> There these kéšpix formed a people of their own. All of them, big and small, took great joy in kálaka, a game of ball. Once, powerful Táruwalem appeared quite suddenly in the east and set fire to the entire region. Later, when he wanted to withdraw the intense heat, he was unsuccessful, so that the kéšpix had to leave the area. Only when Táruwalem himself left the region did it cool off. At that time the whole world burned up all at once, and later everything cooled off again.
