A long time ago the waters of the Stikine and Taku met in the valley north of Telegraph Creek. The head waters of the two rivers joined south of New York Lake, near where Hyland's horse-ranch is now situated. The remains of the shallow lake which connected the two streams may be discerned yet. The salmon and other fish from the two rivers always met and fought at this place. The Taku River fish and the Stikine River fish gathered to have a decisive battle. The two war-parties coming from opposite directions met at the head waters, and a big fight ensued. King-Salmon fought Steel-Head, and took his anklets away: therefore the king-salmon is thick around the root of the tail now, and the steel-head is thin. Steel-Head tore off King-Salmon's ear-ornaments: therefore he has red marks now below the ears. Sucker was clubbed so badly, that his bones were all broken; and therefore his small bones are now all through his flesh. Some informants say that the result of the battle was a draw, and that it was then arranged that the head waters of the two rivers should be separated.
