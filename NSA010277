For a long time the Yoálox family wandered through the wide world until they finally came to where we Yamana live today. Here they began doing all kinds of work. When the [real] people, who were born right here came into being, the Yoálox taught them how to arrange their lives, how to act toward one another, and how they should interact. The Yoálox also showed the people all kinds of implements and utensils, weapons and tools, and taught them how to use these things successfully. They were, of course, very able men, and consequently invented the various weapons and tools that we use to this day in hunting and fishing, in collecting, and killing animals. They also showed us how to reach the animals in the water and on land - the big whales and sea lions, the otters and foxes, the many birds, the shellfish and crustaceans - and how to skin the animals and make the skin serviceable, how to utilize and prepare the meat. All this the Yoálox invented and taught the people. The cleverest of them was Yoálox-tárnuxipa; the younger of her brothers was, in turn, far superior to the elder. From them it can be seen that a younger brother is often smarter and more talented than his elder brother.
