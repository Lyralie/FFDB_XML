When the Creator had finished creating the world, and had returned to the sky, he sent down the cock to see whether the world was good or not, with orders to come back at once. But the world was so beautiful, that the cock, unable to tear himself away, kept lingering on from day to day. At last, after a long time, he was on his way flying back up to the sky. But God, angry with him for his <pb n="9"/>disobedience, stretched forth his hand, and beat him down to earth, saying: "You are not wanted in the sky any more."
That is why, to this very day, the cock cannot fly high.
