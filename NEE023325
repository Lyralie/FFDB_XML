<pb n="90"/>Taʼ Tawas lived alone with his daughter-in-law. His son had gone away for a while to work for gob [Malays]. Taʼ Tawas forced his daughter-in-law to sleep with him. He threatened her with his knife.<note>Parents- and children-in-law must treat each other with respect. Those of opposite sex cannot sit close to each other. It is <ref target="g:GEE2143.048">tolah</ref> to break these rules. For them to have sexual intercourse is regarded as a serious infringement of traditional behaviour. Although this particular myth is always recounted whenever I ask if in-laws might "marry" each other, in this legend no serious consequences befell the main Characters.</note> One day the daughter-in-law ran away. After a while she returned. She was pregnant. When her stomach had become large, but she was not yet ready to give birth, her husband returned. He looked at his pregnant wife. "Mother has slept with grandfather," his child told him. The husband picked up a stick with many spikes to hit his father. Taʼ Tawas ran away when he saw this. He ran first to the house of one of his daughters. On the way he came across a monitor lizard which he killed and brought with him. "Is that you, Father?" asked his daughter when she saw him, "what is the matter?" "The child has slept with his mother," he lied. His daughter did not believe him and she was angry, so Taʼ Tawas ran on to another daughter. Here he told them the truth, that he had slept with his daughter-in-law. The daughter became very angry when she heard this. She hit her father, so he ran on. After a while he arrived at the house of his youngest daughter, Bongso. When he told her what he had done she did not become angry with him, and he lived in her house. 
After a while the husband came to Bongso's house. "Your child was born last night," he told his father, "you can do the necessary.<note>It is the role of a father to aid his wife's birth if he is present.

When he heard this, Taʼ Tawas cut a bamboo to carry the water for washing the mother and child with. He made beautiful designs<note>The designs such bamboo containers are similar to the one incised on the blowpipe and on the cane girdle.</note> on it, and went to his daughter-in- law. He remained living with her. His son went far away where he lived alone.
