ǀχụé was water; and the water was [in] the shadow of the tree. And the wood pigeons ate [409] the fruit of the ǀkŭí. And ǀχụé was a lizard [[This lizard [called also ggóru and nggóru by my ǃkuŋ informants and ǀhãi-ʘpụá by ǀhaŋǂkass'ō] appears to be the common Gecko.]] and lay in the dead leaves of the ǀkŭí. And [he] saw the wood pigeons, and was water. [[He] was not a large [piece of] water, but [?] was a little water, a water hole.]] And the wood pigeons saw the water, and settled upon the water's edge. And ǀχụé worked large grass, like reeds, and it took hold of a wood pigeon. And the wood pigeons came to drink [lit. to eat] water, and the grass [[ǀχụé was a grass which is [called] go, and [is] small; and bit the wood pigeon. Large grass, which is [called] reeds, took hold of the wood pigeon; and was ǀχụé.]] came near, and bit the wood pigeon's bill, and the wood pigeon cried out; and the other wood pigeons flew away.
And ǀχụé was ǀχụé and rose up, and took hold of the wood pigeon, and plucked out the wood pigeon's feathers, and put the wood pigeon's feathers in his head, and lay upon the ground. And the water vanished, and he was and put the wood pigeon's feathers in his head, and lay upon the ground. And [he] put the wood pigeon's body into the hot embers, and lay down. And continued to lie down, and arose, and went to take out the wood pigeon's body from the fire.
And [he] ate the wood pigeon, and heard Ovahereró, and arose. And went to the Ovahereró, and the Ovahereró saw him. And he hid himself on the ground. The Ovahereró came to search for him, to search for him, [and] did not see him. For [he] was little, and was a ǀnŭ-èrre; [[A [certain] little bird.]] and a little Omuhereró boy saw the ǀnŭ-èrre upon a bush, and [411] he saw the Ovahereró, and cried out. [[And [he] cried: "Tsŭáï! tsŭáï! tsŭáï!" [Two] Ovahereró children saw him; for he was a ǀnŭ-érre. | ǀχụé was a ǀnŭ-érre, and cried out. He was not one ǀnŭ-érre; but was many ǀnŭ-érre.]] And was the Bushman's eye water and fell upon the ground. And he said: "Yé-he! Yé-he! Yé-he!" And the Omuhereró heard, and sought for him, sought for him, sought for him, and did not see him, and [he, ǀχụé] flew away.
And [he, ǀχụé] [[ He was [now] not many ǀnŭ-érre, bat was one ǀnŭ-érre, and went to his mother's country.]] flew, coming to his mother's country, and saw his father, and was not a ǀnŭ-érre but was ǀχụé, and died. [[He carried over his shoulder a little bag, the skin of an antelope, a female antelope's skin.]] And his father went to him, and came to look at him, and he was dead. And his father went away, and he was not dead, and was and rose up. He called to his father: "My father! O!" and his father called to him, and said: "My child! O!" and he called to his father once, and cried out: "ǂnò! ǂnò!" and came to his mother's country.
And his father saw him and stealthily approached him. And he heard his father. And [he] saw his father, and died; and was a lizard, and lay down, lay down upon the ground.
And his father saw him, and said: "It is my child, ǀχụé! for it is not another person, but is my child; and [he] saw me, and died. And [he] was rubbing sticks [to make] fire; and saw me, and died; and is not another person, but is my child, and is ǀχụé. For, I went [?] away to my country, and did not see my child; and to-day, [413] I saw my child, and my child was rubbing fire, little sticks' fire; [[The tree's name was ǀn'áu-ǀkumm; and [he had] two sticks; the fire stick [i.e., the one which he held in his hands] was long, small, and long, like a reed. The other [fire] stick lay on the ground; for he had laid [it] the other stick upon grass; he rubbed fire, the fire fell upon the grass; and he took up the fire [i.e., the grass], he blew the fire.]] and my child rubbed fire, and saw me, and died. And is ǀχụé; and is not another person, but is ǀχụé. I am afraid of my child, for my child is dead.
"I go to my country; and my country is far away, and [during] many moons I go to my country, [and] do not see my country; my country is far distant. And, to-day, I see my child, for my child is and makes fire, little sticks' fire, and eats ǀshána, [[Tshána is the name of a tall fruit-bearing tree. The fruit of it is eaten raw.]] and rubs fire, and his hands hurt [him], and he cries, and sees me, and dies; for I am ǀχé-ǁn'ù and my child, ǀχụé, sees me, and dies; and I am afraid of my child. I go away to my country, my country that [?] is far distant.
"And my child is another person; I see my child. And [I] wear in my head wood pigeons' feathers; and my child saw me, my head with wood pigeons' feathers, many wood pigeon feathers, for they [?] were two wood pigeons. And, to-day, I am afraid of my child, and [I] go to my [own] country."
And [he] went to his [own] country; the name of his country is ǁnọā; it is a mountain, a large mountain. And he went away to his [own] country.
