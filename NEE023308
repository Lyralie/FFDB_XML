<pb n="10"/>In the old days Tiger did not eat human beings. She would go to places where people lived and take a small child and bring it to her own house where she would look after it and rear it. When the child became old it would return to its mother and father, and Tiger would take another small child instead and bring it up. Each time the child had grown up, however, Tiger would let it go home. People did not mind letting Tiger have the children, they knew that she would 1ook after them well. 
Then one day as Tiger was carrying a new child back to her house, she met a toad who asked her what she was doing. "I am bringing my new child home," replied Tiger. "That is not your child, that is our meat (ai)" said the toad. "No, no," said Tiger, "It is my child. I look after it." "It is very good to eat," the toad told her, "We'll eat it together". "No, no, it is my child," insisted Tiger. But the toad took the child and struck it so hard that it died. Then she cut it up into little pieces, put them in a bamboo and cooked it. When it was cooked she gave some meat to the tiger. "Try a little, it is very good," she told the tiger who then tasted just a tiny bit. "Oh, it is very good!" exclaimed Tiger, and together the toad and Tiger finished eating the child. Once having got the taste for human flesh, Tiger wanted more, and she killed and ate the next human child she took. When people found out that Tiger was eating their children, they no longer gave away their children to her. From then on tigers have been hunting humans.
