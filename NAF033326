One day <persName>Kauha</persName>'s wives turned into <plant>kitwa</plant> fruits. But <pb n="81"/>before they did that, they played another trick on him. This is what they did: the wives made a baby <animal>giraffe</animal>. They made it and from their sexual secretions; stood it up in the <plant>bush</plant>. They made the baby <animal>giraffe</animal>, and then went home to tell <persName>Kauha</persName>. "We found a baby <animal>giraffe</animal> out in the <plant>bush</plant>. Tomorrow you can go and kill it." All night they wives sat and fidgeted, waiting impatiently for the sun to come up. "When is it going to be morning so he can go kill that baby <animal>giraffe</animal>?" they said to each other.
Finally dawn broke, and they set off. When <persName>Kauha</persName> first saw the <animal>giraffe</animal>, he wanted to beat it to death. But his wives said, "You don't beat a baby <animal>giraffe</animal>! If you do, you'll break its skin, and the blood will all spill. Just jump and kill it with your bare hands. Just leap and grab it." <persName>Kauha</persName> was surprised at their request, but he jumped to grab it anyway. "ǃKum!" He fell right into the middle of the pile of sexual secretions. He swam around helplessly there, and his wives ran off and left him.
The women ran away and turned into <plant>kitwa</plant> and were dangling from <plant>vines</plant>. They swung in the breeze and ripened. Meanwhile, <persName>Kauha</persName> had finally gotten out of the pile of muck and had come after his wives. He saw the ripe <plant>kitwa</plant> hanging on their <plant>vines</plant>, and so he picked them and ate them. When he had swallowed them, the wives lay in his stomach and said "huh!"
"I hear you!" said <persName>Kauha</persName>. "I know you're there! I hear you!" Then along came a very small <animal>bird</animal> called a <persName>ǂdoru</persName>, who <pb n="82"/>pecked <persName>Kauha</persName>'s stomach open. The <animal>bird</animal> flew away, and the wives jumped out. <epimyth>Yes, that's how it happened.</epimyth>
