ǃGara tried screwing his wife in the nostrils. Then he tried her ears. Finally, he screwed her nostrils again. He was getting nowhere.
His wife looked at him, and said, "Don't you know anything? What do you think you're doing in my nostrils and my ears? Can't you see that there's a much better place, here? This is what you eat, you fool."
ǃGara was a person who was really ignorant. He was definitely stupid and didn't know how things were.
