Once there was a man who was very ill. The people said spells and they conducted <ref target="g:GEE2143.025">nöpoh</ref>, but he did not get any better. The man himself was <ref target="g:GEE2143.032">putao</ref> and one day he got up and wandered off into the jungle. He met the giant turtle king who lived in a stone in the river. The turtle king asked him what he wanted. The man told him that he was very ill, but nobody was able to cure him. The turtle king then did a <ref target="g:GEE2143.025">nöpoh</ref>. He made <ref target="g:GEE2143.025">nöpoh</ref> three nights in a row. The man became better and he went back home. "Where have you been?" asked all the people. "Oh, I met the turtle king and he made <ref target="g:GEE2143.025">nöpoh</ref> for three nights and now I am well again," the man told them. He also told them that from then on nobody must eat turtle meat because they are people. Since then the Jah Hut have not been eating turtle meat, as it is <ref target="g:GEE2143.041">talaiden</ref> for them to do so.<note>This legend was told by Beng as an example of the different traditions of the neighbouring Jah Hut. Beng said that for the Chewong it was permissible to eat turtle flesh. "We do not know that turtles are people," he said. This legend demonstrates Chewong awareness of the traditions of their neighbours, and also that they have no conceptual difficulties in accepting these as being valid for the Jah Hut, but not for themselves. Whether the Jah Hut would tell the legend in the way that the Chewong presented it I do not know. Certainly, they do not employ the words <ref target="g:GEE2143.025">nöpoh</ref>, <ref target="g:GEE2143.032">putao</ref>, or <ref target="g:GEE2143.041">talaiden</ref> (see Couillard 1980).</note>
