Everyone despised him, which angered him the more, and made him try even harder to do everybody harm. He was extremely powerful and wielded great authority.

Also all the forests burned down, and from that time to this very day the mountaintops have remained bald and bare. All this happened because at the height of his fury he produced tremendous heat.

His whole family was shunned and despised by all the people, because each member of that family was unkind, always bent on hurting others. Only Lem, the son of old Táruwalem, was remarkably different, showing great kindness toward the rest of the people. He was an excellent hunter and skilled in many things.

Now he has lost his original strength; today he is visible no longer. Only after the great revolution in the women's kína did Lem also ascend into the sky to join his father Táruwalem.
