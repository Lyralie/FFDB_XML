A man was blessed with a sister and mother, but unfortunately was without good sense, and for this reason he was known as <persName>Wabassi</persName> [lit., a sickly person]. His sister had a <animal>dog</animal> called <persName>Warribisi</persName> [lit., a <animal>wasp</animal>]. One day <persName>Wabassi</persName> went down to the seashore to catch big <animal>bunari crabs</animal>, and just as he was about to step out of the boat, an immense <animal>tiger</animal> approached; thinking it was his sister's <animal>dog</animal>, he exclaimed: "<persName>Warribisi</persName>! <persName>Warribisi</persName>! Come on! What are you doing here?" And as the <animal>creature</animal> trotted up quite close, he seized it round the waist, and tried to pull it into the boat. Of course the <animal>tiger</animal> growled, but all <persName>Wabassi</persName> said was, "Don't bite me, <persName>Warribisi</persName>," and as the <animal>animal</animal> was too heavy and clumsy to be dragged in, he lost his temper and said: "Stupid <persName>Warribisi</persName>. Stay where you are, then, and may <animal>Tiger</animal> come and eat you!" When <persName>Wabassi</persName> got home, he told his sister that he had seen her <animal>dog</animal>. She said: "No, you did not. You cannot be in your right senses. <persName>Warribisi</persName> has been here with me all the time." On another occasion <persName>Wabassi</persName> joined some friends and relatives on a hunting expedition: they came across a herd of <animal>bush-hog</animal>, and <persName>Wabassi</persName> shot one. By and by, his friends collected into one big heap all the <animal>hogs</animal> that they had shot, and <persName>Wabassi</persName> came to have a look at their spoil, leaving his own <animal>quarry</animal> behind. "Oh!" said he, "my <animal>bush-hog</animal> is different from these. Mine has a mark on his head, and a flat nose." So the other hunters told him to go and fetch it and let them have a look. When they saw it, they were much surprised to recognize a <animal>tiger</animal>, and still more so to learn that his captor had not even met with a scratch. Next day after they reached home. <persName>Wabassi</persName> dressed himself like a <animal>bird</animal>, with a feather [representing the tail] stuck into his belt behind; he climbed a high <plant>tree</plant> and jumped from limb to limb three times; on the fourth occasion he alighted on a dry limb, which broke, and he fell to earth. "How splendidly I can fly!" he remarked, when he picked himself up.
