<note>That this curious belief, that the wind now wears the form of a bird, was even lately in active existence among the Bushmen, the following will suffice to show: - </note>
Smoke's Man<note>ǁgóö-ka-ǃkụĭ, or "Witbooi Tooren", was the son of ǁkhabbo ["Oud Jantje Tooren"] and his wife, ǃkụábba-aŋ ["Oude Lies"]. ǀhaŋǂkass'ō used to teach "Witbooi" how to hunt springbok; being already grown up when "Witbooi" was still a child.</note> was the one who formerly spoke to me about the wind, when he was still living with his master, Jacob Kotzé.<note>Jacob Kotzé is a Bastaard. He used to live at "Hartus Kloof".</note> He said that the place at which he had seen the wind was Haarfontein;<note>Haarfontein's mountains in which he saw the Wind.</note> while its Bushman name is ǂkōäχă; while its name [by] which the Europeans call it, is Haarfontein.
Smoke's Man espied the wind at Haarfontein's mountain. Therefore, he was throwing a stone at the wind, while he believed [it] to be a ǃkụerreǃkụerre [a certain bird]. And the wind burst on account of it. Therefore, the wind did not blow gently; the wind raised the dust, because he had thrown a stone at the wind. The wind raised the dust, while the wind flew away. The wind went into a mountain's hole, and the wind burst; the wind did not gently blow.
And he [Smoke's Man], being afraid, went home; he went to sit under the hut's bushes,<note>i.e. the bushes broken off and used to make a shelter for the mat hut.</note> while he <pb n="111"/>did not look to the sheep. The sheep<note>The "Africander" sheep [those with the thick tails] will [ǀhaŋǂkass'ō says] return home alone; while the "Va'rland" sheep do not return home alone, but remain where they were left. | ǃk'ōä is the name for "Va'rland sheep, or "Moff". | ǃgĕi is the name for "Africander sheep, "Kaap Schaap."</note> by themselves, the sheep returning came, while he sat under the [hut's] bushes; while he felt that he did not perceive the sheep on account of the dust. Therefore, he went to sit under the [hut's] bushes, while he desired that the dust should settle for him, he sat under the [hut's] bushes, sat close under the hut's sheltering bushes, while he felt that he sat warming himself; while he felt that the place was cold. Therefore, he sat under the [hut's] bushes, while he felt that he sat warming himself. And he afterwards arose, he drove bringing the sheep<note>The sheep stand upon a bare [unenclosed] place, the Bastaard's sheep. Therefore, the shepherd dwells [i.e. has his hut] on this side of the sheep; the wagon stands on that [the opposite] side of the sheep, while the sheep stand between.</note> to the kraal, while he felt that the sun had met. Therefore he again, he went to sit under the [hut's] bushes, while he wished that his mother should be the one to bring him food.<note>He was [at that time] a child.</note> Therefore, he came to sit under the [hut's] bushes, when he had brought the sheep to the kraal. He went to sit under the hut's bushes, while his mother who worked there,<note>Worked at the master's, the Bastaard's.</note> she would be the one to bring him food. Therefore, he sat under the [hut's] bushes, while he desired that he might lie down.
Therefore, his mother worked [and] worked, <pb n="113"/>his mother brought him food. Therefore, he ate up this little food, he lay down; while he felt that the Bastaards are not accustomed to give food liberally. "Silla" was the one who gave food liberally, Jacob Kotzé's wife, while she felt that she was a Bushman [woman]; she speaks the Bushman [language]. We used, being satisfied, to leave the food which she gave to us. I used to live with her [i.e. at her place]. Silla [and] Jacob Kotzé, they are those with whom I used to live.
