The earth is animate and the same as our mother; for, if there were no earth, there would be no people. The latter are her children, and the animals also. She looks after them all, and provides food for all. The rocks are her bones, and water her milk. A child cannot live without sucking its mother's milk, and people cannot live without water. At first there were not many people on earth, and but few game-animals. Later, when people increased in numbers, more game-animals were made to supply their wants. All game were born of a woman:<note>Compare "Atsᴇntmāʼ, or the Meat-Mother" (see p. 230). - J. A. TEIT.</note> therefore animals are the same as people; they are of the same blood, and are relatives. 
The Sun-Man formerly lived on earth, but lives in the sky now. He is called "Sun-Father." He is a good man, and tries to make the people happy. He gives sunshine and warmth. When the people see his face, they are glad. When he becomes sick or sorrowful, he hides his face, and then we have clouds and rain. The Sun was a handsome man when on earth. He had a good-looking face, so bright that people could barely look at it. He was always happy and good.<note>According to the "Story of the Sun" (see below), Sun, when on earth, was an evil man, and killed people. In Salish stories he is generally spoken of as a bad man who killed people (see MAFLS 6 : 53). - J. A. TEIT.</note>
