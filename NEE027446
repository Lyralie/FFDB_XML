Literary translation.
There were many people of old in Paratunnai, but they all came to die, so that at last there only remained one woman, named Inanupirika, with her relations: only enough persons for a single dwelling. Then a wealthy man of Taraika desired to wed Inanupirika; he desired to wed her, but she would not have him: and this rich man of Taraika finally returned to his village. Now again the people who were with Inanupirika came to die, one after another. And therefore, it was not possible to dwell there in Paratunnai any longer. So they went to the sea-shore, and sailed away; away they sailed, the whole company. They sailed to Moriruesan, where they built a house, and lived there a long time. But the men said: "There are Ainu villages; if we sail thither and live all together amongst the Ainu folks, it will be well. There, living beside our Ainu people, we may once more behold our village and - since men are there, - have offspring, and go away again, to Paratunnai and rebuild our village: and it will be well". Thus rightly spoke the men. But Inanupirika, who had formerly refused those that would have wedded her, was against sailing towards her Ainu home. And Inanupirika prevailed in speech against them. Wherefore the men, making up their minds, departed for Karere and Vennai, where they built a house, a storehouse that they filled up with smoked fish, which having accomplished, they now might eat their food in winter quarters. But the man Ukantu of Camoki was fain to wed that woman Inanupirika; and she refused him. He waxed wroth, and went home to his village. And this man Ukantu, <pb n="52"> when there was a great snowstorm and the weather was bad in winter, came to Vennai; with his axe did he hew down the pillars of the storehouse of the men of Vennai, and making it fall, wrecked it utterly. And then he returned home to his village and abode there. But the people who dwelt in Vennai could not go to their storehouse, for the weather was too bad; and they lived in houses dug in the earth, wherein there was no food; and though they would fain have gone to the storehouse to seek food, it was impossible. For ten days long, the weather was exceeding bad. When at last it became fair weather, they went down to the storehouse. When they got there, they saw plainly that some man had with an axe hewn down the storehouse pillars, so that it had fallen. All the food there had been devoured by foxes and pine-martens; only a very little remained. And therefore the people went together, and ate it up. But spring not having yet arrived, they soon were hungry, and there was no food at all for them now. The men went together to the earth house; the women, adorning themselves as if already dead, put beads round their necks and arrayed themselves in silken robes. This done, they all lay down together. Together they all lay down, no food was in sight, they knew for sure that they were all to starve to death. After which every one of them died. Thereafter Ukantu, the man of Camoki, who had desired to wed Inanupirika but could not do so, was nevertheless commanded by his elder brother to visit the dwellers in Vennai. Thus went Ukantu's younger brother to visit Vennai: where he found that all the people had died, evidently of hunger. He saw, and returned home. Then the men of Taraika, the kindred of Inanupirika, heard; and now they went by boat to Vennai, and hunted bears there. They came from the sea of Karere, they came to Vennai. There they saw the house that had two hearths; it had fallen, the beams thereof were scattered one upon the other on the ground. Within they saw the great iron pots, visible from the interior of the adjoining forest. This also did the Ainus see, and thus <pb n="53">goes the tradition. And as this was so, we see that it is not right that men should give up their souls to the discourse of women; to yield to the discourse of women has been a dangerous thing from olden times. And therefore do the old men now living tell this for instruction of their children.
