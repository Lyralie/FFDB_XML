NEE027828
An old man [who had] prophetic forebodings, went to the mountains one winter for a certain purpose. [He] made a hut of fir-branches. Having made the hut, [he] passed the night [there]. Whilst [he] slept in the night, the following voice was [heard]: "Ećitom-man, hast thou a broad strap? Ećitom-man! hast thou a broad strap?" Such was the voice. Having heard [it he] quite lost consciousness. Thereupon [he <pb n="115">saw] at the end of the hearth a woman in a dress of seal-skin: a woman having in [her] mouth a long pipe was sitting. 
After, when he had to go out, - to go out to one that called him, - the woman smoking at the end of the hearth struck him with [her] bony wrist; [and he] awoke. When [he] looked, that woman was not [to be seen]. The next day [he] went out; when [he] looked round, behind the hut a pinemarten surely had called him.
