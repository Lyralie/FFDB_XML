<p>A long time ago some people killed a large snake (naga). They cooked it and ate the fat. There is a lot of nice fat on snakes. They did not cook the head, however. This they cut off and put on a nearby tree stump. All the people partook of the snake fat. When they had eaten, it began to rain and storm. Water welled up from the ground and the people climbed up a tall tree. The snake head which they had left became a real snake again and when the people climbed down from the tree the snake swallowed them all. Only one couple managed to escape. They ran towards a tall mountain. The snake followed, but they did not realize this. When they had built a small house, the wife, who was pregnant, went to bathe in a nearby river. After she had bathed, she sat down to comb her hair. She chose to sit on what she thought was a tree trunk, but it was the snake's head. She did not know this. The next day she was no longer pregnant. Her husband looked at her stomach and asked, "Where is the child in your stomach?" The wife did not know what had happened. Not only had she lost her unborn child, from then on the woman was barren. Once the snake had eaten all the people and made the woman barren it became a bi inhar and moved to the sea which is its real homeland. </p>
