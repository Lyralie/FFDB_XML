<p>The ǃʼõǃʼõ bird found some honey one day, and was chopping it out of the tree. ǁgauwa heard his axe ringing. He heard the sounds of chopping, and he followed them. The ringing of the axe led him right to where ǃʼõǃʼõ was. ǁgauwa sat down to watch how he was chopping out the honey. He said to himself, "Won't I get some of this honey to eat?" He looked at all the honey ǃʼõǃʼõ had chopped down. Then he asked for some of it to eat. "Won't you give me a little of your honey?" But ǃʼõǃʼõ refused. "This honey is mine," he said, "this is my honey. And Iʼm not going to give you any." So ǁgauwa just sat and watched him chop. He chopped until he was finished, and then he took out all the honey. He packed it up and got up and left.</p>
<p>Later ǁgauwa went to ǃʼõǃʼõʼs house and stole all that honey. ǃʼõǃʼõ didnʼt have a bit of honey left. ǁgauwa took it all and went off and ate it. ǃʼõǃʼõ fought with him over it, but ǁgauwa had eaten it all. The ǃʼõǃʼõ went away empty-handed. That's what ǃʼõǃʼõ and ǁaiha did, ǃʼõǃʼõ and Kauha. That's the story of these two and the honey. God took the honey away from ǃʼõǃʼõ. And ǃʼõǃʼõ, the owner of the honey, got none of it to eat and had to go away with nothing. They fought and fought, Kauha took the honey and ǃʼõǃʼõ went off empty-handed.</p>
