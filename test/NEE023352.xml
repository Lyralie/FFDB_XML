<p>Once a couple went to the sea with their baby. They were hungry, and went to look for food. They put down the baby while they were gone. The baby cried and cried, and a snake (naga) heard the crying. He<note>This demonstrates that the snakes which live underneath Earth Seven, in the ocean, are not associated with women only, although the Original Snake that punishes <ref target="g:GEE2143.041">talaiden</ref> offences is female.</note> emerged from the deep ocean to see what it was that was crying so. He saw the abandoned baby and picked it up carefully and brought it back with him to the sea. He gave the child to his wife who took off her snake "cloak" and looked after the child as if it were her own. They were snake people. Time passed and the child grew up. He went hunting with his snake father, being carried on the snake's back. </p>
<p>After a while he wanted to see the world of humans. He went with his snake mother and snake father. They met a river snake and she and the mother snake from the sea quarrelled. The mother snake died, having had her head split open by the river snake. The father went hunting. He caught wild pig and deer. Bongso then wanted to go up to the sky. He went ahead of his snake father. He arrived in the evening. The sun was inside a large bamboo.<note>The Chewong have two explanations for the sun's movement. One is that she follows a path across the sky which goes below Earth Seven at night. Another is that the sun goes to sleep inside a bamboo every night.</note> She had eaten all her children. The moon still had her children.<note>This refers to the myth, "How the sun lost her children" in Part I.</note> "Is that you, Bongso?" asked the sun when Bongso approached. "It is," replied he. "Who is that with you?" she wanted to know. "It is my father," said Bongso. "I don't want him," said the sun, so the snake returned to the sea. The sun wanted to eat Bongso. She placed him in another bamboo. They went to sleep. The next morning the sun came out. "Wait for me here," she told Bongso, "I'll be back in the evening." The moon had overhead what the sun was saying. She went up to Bongso and asked him "What are you doing here?" "I am waiting for the sun," he told her. "Don't," said the moon, "She wants to eat you." The moon then told her son Awang Bintang<note>This name is from the Malay. Awang means young fellow, and bintang means star.</note> to take Bongso to the house of Taʼ Chinbutn<note>Grandfather spider.</note>. They went. </p>
<p>When they were sitting in Taʼ Chinbutn's house, a man came to visit. His daughter was very sick and he wanted someone to perform the healing rites for her. He asked if Bongso knew how to do it. He agreed to help and went to the man's house. He did a <ref target="g:GEE2143.025">nöpoh</ref> and the girl became well again. After a while Bongso and the girl were married. There was another old couple living in this settlement. They were very sad for they had no children. The old woman told Bongso how she had lost her baby son one day a long time before when they had left him by the sea while searching for food. Bongso realized that she was his real mother. </p>
