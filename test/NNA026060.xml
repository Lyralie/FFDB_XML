<p><note>See RBAE 31 : 731 (Haida, Hare, Tlingit, Tsimshian).</note> [NETCEÊ¼NSTA<note>Said to mean 'earth-mother.'</note>] </p>
<p>The Earth-Mother lives under the earth, and holds it up. The earth is like a crust or blanket spread out flat, and she is like a post that holds it up. Sometimes she gets tired and shifts her position; or sometimes the earth sags in some place where the weight is on it, and then she moves her arm to put it up. Then we have an earthquake. Earth-Mother is becoming older and weaker all the time, and  by and by she will not be able to hold up the earth any longer. Then it will fall into the water which is below the earth, and disappear. Once Earth-Mother told the people, "When you feel an earthquake, you must not be alarmed. It is only because I am a little tired, and am shifting my position. It is no sign and that I am going to fall down, and that the earth will come to an end." Therefore people are not afraid of earthquakes. </p>
