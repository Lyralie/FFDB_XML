<p>Old Hášaxuwa had two grandsons who lived with him in his hut. He<note>The male of the southern elephant seal, Macrorhinus leoninus; cf. Gusinde 1937:482, fig. 40.</note> was very niggardly and stingy; he gave his two grandsons only very little to eat. In his hut hung the stomach of a big sea lion<note>The stomach of a sea lion is blown up tightly and hung up to dry; then it serves as a container, primarily for whale oil. It can easily be carried around everywhere and does not leak.</note> filled with delicious oil, but he let his grandsons have only small amounts of this. And even this small amount he scrupulously measured out in the little shell of an auwéra mussel.<note>The patella, which is common there on the beaches.</note> That was all they got every day. Although they demanded more he inexorably allowed them only this tiny amount. The two grandsons grew thinner from day to day and hungrily implored the old man: "Come now, give us a little more to eat!" Sullenly the old man would answer: "I don't have enough oil to give you more. I have only a little bit left and that we must use very sparingly!" Since the two grandsons would not stop begging him, stingy Hášaxuwa put them off with harsh words and said at last: "Now the sea lion oil is finished!" </p>
<p>Both boys had become terribly thin. They considered killing stingy Hášaxuwa, for they were convinced that he was keeping the oil hidden, intending not to give them any more of it. One day they tiptoed out of the hut and ran far away; they wanted to search the beach for something with which to appease their hunger. During their search they <pb n="112"/>came upon a big shell of the auwéra mussel. They ran back to their hut to show their grandfather the big mussel shell, saying: "Look what a big auwéra shell we've found! Couldn't you fill it up with oil for us? Until now you've only filled a very small auwéra shell for us which barely holds a few drops." Stingly Hášaxuwa immediately inquired: "Where did you find this big mussel shell?" The two grandsons answered: "Come with us! We'll show you the island where we found it. There are very many of these big auwéra!" The three of them set out at once. When they reached the island the two grandsons said to their grandfather: "This is where the big auwéra are!" When the old man bent over to pick up the mussels the two grandsons suddenly sneaked up behind him and gave him a hard push. Heavy Hášaxuwa rolled down the beach into the water and drowned. </p>
<p>The two grandsons ran back to their hut at once. Here they looked through everything and discovered a large amount of sea lion oil which their stingy grandfather had kept hidden. They were beside themselves with joy. But on the inside of the auwéra shell to this day one can still clearly discern the mark<note>Inside the mussel shell the lower part is dark-colored, contrasting sharply with a lighter upper ring. One is justified to call this a dividing mark.</note> up to which stingy Hášaxuwa filled the mussel shell with sea lion oil for his two grandsons. </p>
