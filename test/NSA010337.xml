<p>Once there were two yékamuš who must be counted among the most skillful ever. The people in the west were then in great distress, for bad weather had made it impossible for a long time either to hunt sea lions or gather mussels. The yékamuš saw the desperate situation, and one of them fell into a sleep so as to be active in his dreams. The next morning the yékamuš told his people: "Move farther west, and stay on the south shore!" All the families broke camp at once and set off. The following night the yékamuš dreamed once more and the next morning he said: "[In my dream] I saw two whales approaching us. They are sisters. Both are pregnant; each has a nearly full-grown calf in her womb. Out there in the ocean an ašóula [the small grampus, Pseudorca crassidens] approached and threatened them. The two sisters implored it insistently: 'Don't kill us! If you do, the calves within us will also die, and so you would be killing four living beings all at once!' The ašóula was not to be moved, however, and mercilessly killed the two whales. Soon they'll be in sight, and they'll be washed ashore here." The people were extremely happy over what their yékamuš had told them. And indeed, that same evening the tide washed up two huge whales there on the level coast. They were females, and when the people cut them open they found the calves inside of them. Their astonishment perdured for a long time. </p>
