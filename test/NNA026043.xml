<p>Raven made figures of men and women, an equal number of each. He divided them by sexes. Then he divided them in groups. There were four groups, - Raven men, Raven woman, Wolf men, and, Wolf women. Now he said, "Raven men will mate with Wolf woman, and Wolf men will mate with Raven women." A woman of the Wolf phratry happened to be outside the house at the time, and, hearing Raven talking, she listened to what he said. Raven said, "I have made the Raven women the best looking. They are really very good-looking." Raven had to go outside. The woman at once ran inside, and changed the group of Wolf-woman figures to where the Raven-women figures had been.</p>
<p>When Raven returned, he pronounced his decree on the groups, saying, "I have already established the relationship of the sexes and of the phratries. Now I decree that people shall take after the characteristics of these figures I have made. Having made the woman of one side better-looking than those of the other side, henceforth they <pb n="216"/>will be better-looking." The Wolf figures, having been changed to the Raven side, they were thus made the best-looking. Raven did not find out his mistake until after he had uttered his decree; and thus the Wolf women were made good-looking, whereas it was his intention that the Raven women should be the best-looking. This is why women of the Wolf phratry are so good-looking at the present day.</p>
