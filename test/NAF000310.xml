<p><anamyth>I have heard the old people talk, and they say that</anamyth> this man <persName>Kauha</persName> had two wives. They were all living together someplace, they and their children. And the man began all the trouble.</p>
<p>He went hunting one day: he went off hunting and was searching for <animal>animals</animal> but couldn't find any. <apartmyth>(Just as I heard the story, I'm telling it to you.)</apartmyth> And since he didn't see any <animal>animals</animal>, he went home and they all went to sleep. In the morning he got up and went hunting again. He hunted and hunted but didn't see an <animal>animal</animal>. He knew that everyone in the camp was dying of hunger. He said to himself, "O, what am I going to do? What am I going to take home for my wives to eat?"</p>
<p>Then he saw a tall <plant>tree</plant>. He climbed and climbed until he sat in the top of it. Then he jumped out. When he hit the ground his anus came out. It popped right out of his asshole. So he cut it off and sliced it up like meat. He sliced it into strips and put it into his bag. Then he took <plant>grass</plant> and stopped up his empty asshole. He stopped himself up and went home with that meat. When the sun was low he came to his camp.</p>
<p>The children cried "Ho, ho, father has killed an <animal>animal</animal>, father has killed an <animal>animal</animal>!"</p>
<p><persName>Kauha</persName> kept his front turned toward the others. "Don't go behind my back, you scamps," he said to the children. But they danced around until they were behind his back anyway. They saw the <plant>grass</plant> sticking out of his asshole and couldn't imagine what it was. So they just went on praising him for coming home with meat.</p>
<p><pb n="261"/><persName>Heishe</persName> spread out the meat to dry. He took out one strip and gave it to his older wife to roast. When it was done, she took it out of the fire and knocked the ashes off it. Then she started to pound it to make it soft. But it was so hard that it bounced out of her hands and landed in <persName>Kauha</persName>'s lap. Then it disappeared. It had already gone back into <persName>Kauha</persName>'s asshole. They looked for it and looked for it. <persName>Kauha</persName> kept a straight face and just sat there. They looked and looked but couldn't find it. "What on earth can have happened to it?" asked the wives. "There's no <animal>dog</animal> here, so what can have taken it?" So they roasted another piece. This time the older wife said to the younger "You roast it and knock the ashes off; let's see what will happen this time." So the younger wife roasted it. While she was pounding it the same thing happened. The wives said "This has got to stop. Tomorrow we're going to have a look at this meat by daylight. This kind of thing is something we've never seen before." They hung the rest of the meat in a <plant>tree</plant>, and everybody went to sleep.</p>
<p>In the morning when they got up the meat was all gone.</p>
<p>It had all gone back into <persName>Kauha</persName>'s asshole. The wives were very surprised. They left the camp together asking each other "What is this guy up to? He's trying to torment us. Let's go look for bush food and think of a way to fool him." So they went off and soon they found a <plant>tama melon</plant>. When they saw it, they sat down and cut it open and took out the <pb n="262"/>seeds. Then they went home. "What shall we do?" they said to each other. "Let's cut off our labia and hang them up to dry. Then we can pound them up with the tama seeds and set them aside for his food. When he gets home he'll have something to eat, all right! He fooled us, didn't he?" So they did just what they said they would. They ate plain <plant>melon</plant> with the children. Then they filled a bowl with the bad stuff and set it aside for their husband.</p>
<p>When <persName>Kauha</persName> came home they took the bowl and gave it to him. He started to eat it, and then said, "Ai! Who gave you two such a nice piece of hide to pound up with the tama seeds?"</p>
<p>"Um, where was it, um ... in an abandoned camp! We found the skin of a baby <animal>giraffe</animal>. Someone had scraped it and rolled it up and hung it inside a hut. It had rotted, and hunger defeated our scruples, so we took it."</p>
<p>"O!" said <persName>Kauha</persName>. "It tastes so good and salty!" Then they were all finished eating, and they went to sleep. <persName>Kauha</persName> slept badly. He tossed and turned. He tried to sleep, but the smell of what he had eaten kept bubbling up from his insides into his nostrils. Finally he got really angry, and said "O, what on earth have these women given me to eat? What can possibly be smelling so foul? I'll fix them ... they'll be sorry!"</p>
<p>In the morning they all got up and <persName>Kauha</persName> said "I'm going to go off in this direction. Now you two gather carefully in this other direction." Then he went off walking <pb n="263"/>away from the camp. He walked and walked, and as he walked he was thinking very hard. "What am I going to do to those two women?" He walked some more and then he saw a nice <plant latin="Ziziphus mucronata">nǂai tree</plant>. Now today the balls of edible <plant>gum</plant> from this <plant>tree</plant> are <color>red</color> and sweet. That's because on that day <persName>Kauha</persName> took his own testicles and hung them up in the <plant latin="Ziziphus mucronata">nǂai tree</plant>. Then he went back to his wives, and said, "I've found some very nice <plant>gum</plant>. Tomorrow I'll take you both there so you can eat some."</p>
<p>"Hooray for our husband!" shouted the wives. "Where did you find it?"</p>
<p>"Over there," he said. "And I'm not fooling you, even though you deceived me yesterday - no, I don't do that sort of thing. I haven't a thought of that kind in my head."</p>
<p>They all slept and when they got up in the morning they set off. When they got to the <plant latin="Ziziphus mucronata">nǂai tree</plant> the wives said "Yes, indeed, it's nice <plant>gum</plant>! Ooo! Let's look for long sticks to poke it down with. Where will we find a long stick?"</p>
<p>But <persName>Kauha</persName> said "Oh, no, if you poke these balls of <plant>gum</plant>, all the <plant>gum</plant> will spill out! Why don't you climb the <plant>tree</plant> and get right up to them and bite them? That way you won't lose any of the <plant>gum</plant>." So the wives went up the <plant>tree</plant>. One went to one part of the <plant>tree</plant> and the other went somewhere else. They bit into the balls of <plant>gum</plant> - and the terrible things broke right into their mouths!</p>
<p><persName>Kauha</persName> ran off, and his wives began to scream. They came down out of the <plant>tree</plant> crying "What are we going to do? What <pb n="264"/>kind of man is this who has made us eat his bad things?" They complained and cried for awhile, and then they left the <plant>tree</plant>. They thought of what they could do to get back at their husband. "Let's make a baby <animal>giraffe</animal>," they said to each other. "And tomorrow he can go to kill it." So they spent the day doing that. They made the tracks of a big <animal>giraffe</animal> and the tracks of a baby <animal>giraffe</animal>. They made the tracks together, so that it looked like the baby <animal>giraffe</animal> was suckling. Then they dug a pit and defecated until it was full. They fashioned a baby <animal>giraffe</animal> from their defecations, and then said to each other, "It's time to go home."</p>
<p>When their husband came back to camp they said to him "We found a baby <animal>giraffe</animal> in the bush. Where were you hunting that you missed the <animal>giraffe</animal>? A <animal>cow</animal> <animal>giraffe</animal> has given birth, and we saw her. We saw the baby <animal>giraffe</animal> lying on the ground after it was born. Tomorrow we'll go back there so you can kill it."</p>
<p><persName>Kauha</persName> said "My wives, my wonderful wives!" He was very happy. In the morning they got their things together and went after the baby <animal>giraffe</animal>. <persName>Kauha</persName> took his spear with him. "I'll stab it with my spear," he said.</p>
<p>But the wives disagreed. "If you spear it all the blood will run out! We don't want the blood to spill; we want to eat every bit of that baby <animal>giraffe</animal>. Why do you want to spear it? Just jump and grab it. Then we'll help you kill it." So <persName>Kauha</persName> jumped------ǃʼam! he landed in the middle of the pile of <pb n="265"/>crap. The wives ran off. <persName>Kauha</persName> lay there and hollered. He wiped himself off, muttering "death take their crotches! Are these women crazy?"</p>
<p>Finally he was free of the stuff and walked away. As he walked he thought and thought. "What am I going to do to these wives of mine?" Then he saw some bush food that people call <plant>ǂnǂdwa</plant>. Seeing them, he decided to make a big patch of <plant>ǂnǂdwa bushes</plant>. He did that. But they weren't just <plant>bushes</plant>: they looked like <plant>ǂnǂdwa</plant> but they were really people. When he had stood the <plant>ǂnǂdwa</plant> people in a clump like he wanted them, <persName>Kauha</persName> went home. He said to his wives, "There's a patch of <plant>ǂnǂdwa</plant> over that way. Tomorrow we'll go and peel some and roast them to eat. We'll shell them and pound them and bring them home to eat."</p>
<p>"All right," said the two wives. They slept, and in the morning they packed their things and went to the <plant>ǂnǂdwa</plant> patch. <persName>Kauha</persName> was the first to get there because the women were walking slowly. He whispered to the <plant>ǂnǂdwa</plant>, "I'm bringing you some people who have really done me wrong. Now you just sit there and wait for them. I'm going on ahead." When <persName>Kauha</persName> had gotten right into the main clump of <plant>ǂnǂdwa</plant> he called out to his wives, "Come on and walk faster. Catch up with me so we can eat some <plant>ǂnǂdwa</plant>." As the wives came into the clump of <plant>bushes</plant>, the <plant>ǂnǂdwa</plant> people began to beat them with sticks. They beat them and beat them and cracked their heads open. The wives cried and cried for help, but <persName>Kauha</persName> was gone: he had run away. "Hey!" the wives yelled. "What sort of husband is this who has married us and then treats us this way? Why should such a big important person treat people like this? Why doesn't he take good care of us? Instead he's tormenting us."</p>
<p>The two wives went home. They stayed there until their husband came. "By the way, we didn't see any <plant>ǂnǂdwa</plant>," they said to him. "All we saw was a bunch of people. We went into the midst of them and they nearly beat us to death." </p>
<p>"You must have gotten lost," said <persName>Kauha</persName>. "You went the wrong way. There's another camp over there and you must have stumbled right into it." "But we were following your footprints and that's how we nearly got killed!"</p>
<p>But <persName>Kauha</persName> said "Impossible. I didn't see anybody at all on the trail that I took."</p>
<p>The wives lived in discontent for some time. <persName>Kauha</persName> was satisfied and fed them well, but they were discontented just the same. One day one of the wives said "I think I'll go visit my family." <persName>Kauha</persName> refused, and said "No, you're not: we're staying here. Why should we go visit them - they never visit us." So they stayed. But the wife grew restless. "How can I get away?" she wondered. One day when <persName>Kauha</persName> and his son went hunting, she simply ran off alone. The other wife sat in the camp alone and waited for her husband to return.</p>
<p>The wife who had left did not return. The other wife stayed at the camp alone, waiting for her husband. He was <pb n="267"/>off hunting but he did not bring home anything for her to eat. Hunger began to work upon her, and she grew very thin. Soon she had no fat on her buttocks - they were nothing but skin.</p>
<p>One day <persName>Kauha</persName> killed a fat <animal>eland</animal> far from his camp, and came home at last to bring the news. "Hai? Where's my other wife?" he asked. "Oh, she's left," sniffed the wife who had stayed. "And you?" asked <persName>Kauha</persName>, "why do you look so terrible?" "Hunger, obviously," she replied. "Well, if you're going to look like this I'm leaving," said <persName>Kauha</persName>. "You're probably just starving yourself so you'll have an excuse to leave me and run after other men. I'm leaving, and you'll just have to sit here. I'm not interested in a woman who's so thin. You're awfully thin and ugly and you don't interest me at all." With that, <persName>Kauha</persName> took his son and began packing up their belongings. The wife just sat there. <persName>Kauha</persName> packed all his things into a string carrying bag. As they were leaving, his son put out his hand and drew his mother to her feet. "Please, mother, follow us, I beg you," he said. So she walked secretly behind them when they left.</p>
<p>After they had walked a long while, father and son sat down to rest. The son sneaked to where his mother was and found her a comfortable place to sit. <persName>Kauha</persName> rested and ate something and then they travelled further. After a while the son asked his father "Are we almost there?" "Don't worry - the meat is there. We'll come to it," answered <persName>Kauha</persName>.</p>
<p>When they came to the dead <animal>eland</animal>, <persName>Kauha</persName> and his son began <pb n="268"/>cutting it up right away. <persName>Kauha</persName> skinned it and broke its body open. Then he took out its intestines. He dipped out the chyme with his cupped hands and dumped it on the ground. He was still dipping out the chyme when his son said to him "Father, let me take the chyme and throw it away for you. I want to watch the <animal>dung beetles</animal> eat it." (The son wanted the chyme to smoothe on the ground for his mother, so she would have a nice place to sit.) So the father gave it to him and the child sat his mother upon it. Then he came back. "Father!" he said. "Won't you give me that bit of fat so I can watch the <animal>dung beetles</animal> eat it?" <persName>Kauha</persName> cut out the piece of fat for him and he went and gave it to his mother to eat. The son went back and forth between his father and his mother. He spent the whole day taking bits of food to his mother one by one. He and his father would eat a little and then he would take something like the bladder and go to his mother. "I'm going to play with the <animal>dung beetles</animal> and eat my meat over there," the son would say. Then he would go and give whatever it was to his mother.</p>
<p>At last the sun hung low in the sky. <persName>Kauha</persName> said "Since it's so late already, I think we'll just go to sleep and wait until morning to fetch water." "All right," said his son. He went and told his mother. Then they all went to sleep. The wife slept in one place and her husband and son slept together not far away. In the night the son went to check on his mother several times. In the morning <persName>Kauha</persName> went off to fetch water, leaving his son in their new camp. When he was gone, the son <pb n="269"/>told his mother to come and sit with him in the camp. Today she was fat, and very beautiful. She sat with her son in the camp as if she were a lovely python girl.</p>
<p>When a little time had passed, <persName>Kauha</persName> returned and saw her. "Hai? Is this my son who's sitting with such a beautiful woman? Who can it be?" He asked his son, "has your mother returned?" "Yes, mother has come," he answered. "What has she been eating that makes her look so good?" "I don't know: she looked like this when she got here," he said.</p>
<p><persName>Kauha</persName> dropped his water containers and ran to his wife. He climbed on top of her and right away he began screwing her very hard. Her son cried, "Hey! Didn't you nearly kill my mother with hunger, and then abandon her so that I had to feed her myself? Who do you think made her beautiful again? If you think you're going to screw her now, I'll fix you!" <persName>Kauha</persName> was still lying on top of his wife and refused to get off. "Father, give me your axe so I can sharpen it and eat the <animal>eland</animal> bones," said his son. "Hand me the whetstone too." All the while <persName>Kauha</persName> lay on top of his wife and continued to screw her. Suddenly ... (snap!) The boy had chopped his father in two with the axe! He did it to get him off his mother. (He no longer wanted his mother to be his mother; he wanted to marry her.) Then he lifted up his father's body. He took the top half and threw it one way, and threw the bottom half the other way. "When did you suddenly grow up?" asked his mother, as she sat up.</p>
<p><pb n="270"/>"Will you make a fire so we can warm ourselves, mother?" he asked. "Certainly, my son." "I'm not 'your son' any more." "Well, what am I going to call you now? How about 'my little brother'?" But he refused that name too. "My nephew?" But he refused again. "What am I going to call this child?" she wondered out loud. "My husband?" (Snap!) That was all he wanted. He jumped up and ran to the fire. He was looking for <animal>tutus</animal>, <apartmyth>these little <color>black</color> <animal>insects</animal> that smell bad and crawl around near the fire.</apartmyth> When he saw some he lay down in their midst. He wanted them to bite his penis so it would swell up and he would be able to do what he wanted. Well, the <animal>tutus</animal> bit him nearly to death. His penis swelled up until it was enormous. It was so big he couldn't take his mother with it. He had spoiled his own chances! The things that went on long ago ... This is what the old people tell, and this is what I have heard.</p>
