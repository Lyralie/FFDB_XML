<p>Ttò is in the mountain, the ttò mine; the people say that the ttò mine is on the side of the mountain, the people say 'ttò mine' to it.</p>
<p>The people are afraid of it [that is, of the sorcerers who live by the mine], because the people are aware that people are there [sorcerers]. They [the sorcerers] make a house<note>The narrator thinks that their houses are small holes, like mouse-holes.</note> there. Therefore, the people who intend to pound ttò, rub themselves when they [go to] collect ttò. And when they go to the ttò, they throw stones at the ttò mine, when they wish the sorcerers to bide themselves, that they may go undisturbed to work at the ttò, while they feel that the sorcerers dwell at the ttò mine. Therefore, they take up stones, they throw stones at the ttò mine, when they wish the sorcerers to hide themselves, that they may go in peace<note>For, they would be ill, if the sorcerers saw them.</note> to work at the ttò. And they go to work at the ttò, ttò, ttò. They also get ǁhára;<note>The ǁhára mine [literally, "mouth" or "opening "] is in a different place; the ttò mine is also in a different place.</note> they put away the ǁhára and the ttò, and they return home. </p>
