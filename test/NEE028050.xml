<p>E-e-e! - My uncles reared me. [My] two uncles brought me up. Of all the poor and miserable men [that] are, [I was] the poorest. Every day my uncles went a-hunting bears; with me they wished to do [that], but I would not. Last year they [killed] tens of he[-bears] - six tens; - tens of she[-bears] - six tens. </p>
<p>I had two uncle's wives. They woke me to [give me to] eat. When I rose, [then] I ate. Having ate, lay down to sleep. That day my uncles stayed at home. The younger uncle, having risen, took down the ancestors' bow [and] took down the ancestors' quiver, [and] placed [them] before me. Ah! they were splendid! [and] said. </p>
<p>"Nephew reared by us, hitherto with difficulty we have brought thee up. Thou reliest only on thyself. Though we would have gone bear-hunting with thee, thou hast refused; and therefore shalt thou go alone, and alone shalt hunt". So I rose. </p>
<p><pb n="165"/>I took a poor girdle, and girt myself. The ancestors' quiver did I take, the ancestors' bow did I take. I went out, and on the hunting-path I went forth. Ah! it was splendid! On the way on which my uncles went a-hunting, I [too] went forth. </p>
<p>Having gone, I espied one large bear; a male. Though I feared, I strung the ancestors' bow. I lay in wait for that large he-bear. Near me he came. So I drew the bow. When I looked, [I saw that] the arrow had hit the spot I aimed at. Having leapt twice, beside me fell the bear. I then took off the skin, and having made a large bundle, went away [with it]. To my home I went. </p>
<p>My uncles, having seen me, very [cordially] greeted me. "[By our] wish that thou shouldst do this, we have made a man of thee. Now, if we die, after us do thou thus! Afterwards thou wilt dwell in the house of the ancestors, and we <pb n="166"/>shall be very poor old men. Ah! it is splendid! Now look thou well to the ancestors' house". </p>
<p>Thus saying, they fell down on one side of me [and died]. - Ah! it was splendid! I carried an axe about, and went out. A fine tomb [of wood] did I raise. Near the 'inau' I placed it. Afterwards I lived [as usual]. I was still luckier in hunting than my uncles [had been]. </p>
<p>Having two children, and bringing them up, I taught them. Having fallen down on one side, I died. After me, I heard [that] my children did still better than I: I heard [it].</p>
