<p>Several families once went to an island to hunt sea lions, for they had long been lacking blubber and oil. Martúwux-yélluwa went with them. He was very unpopular with all people for he wanted to be number one everywhere; he thought he knew everything best; he considered himself more clever than the rest; he was a braggart and an egoist. Long ago people had all grown tired of him, for he always wanted to be the one to give orders. They were secretly considering playing a trick on him to make him look ridiculous. One day some men said to him: "See that rock over there by the point, the one that juts out from that island? A large sea lion just crawled up on it. You really should harpoon it. You're the only one who knows how to throw the harpoon with precision." These words flattered Túwux<note>The night heron, Nycticorax obscurus.</note> very much. He took his harpoon and ran quickly to that point, which was far away. He went by himself, leaving all his belongings in his hut. After he had gone very far the people packed their own things, loaded them into their canoes, and extinguished all the fires in the huts. They also loaded all that man's things into his wife's canoe. She put out the fire in their hut and took everything that belonged to her and her husband. Everybody left and went to the campsite they had just come from, leaving absolutely nothing behind on the island. Departing they said to one another: "Now he may stay here forever! After all, the island itself will never disappear." Toward evening the man returned to the place where his people's huts had been. But he saw to his dismay that they had all gone. They had taken everything along: canoes, hides, fire and firewood, even his own weapons and tools. Sadly he sat down in his hut, of which only the framework was still standing; everything inside was missing, even the fire. He was cold and hungry. </p>
<p>When the people reached the old camp everybody went silently into the huts. But the father of the man they had deserted on the island soon realized that his son had not come with them, for nobody had spoken to him about his son. That seemed very suspicious to him and he <pb n="156"/>suspected something bad. His daughter-in-law did not tell him anything either, for she was staying in the hut of her own kin. </p>
<p>Once he was sitting in his hut with only his grandson. A long time had passed, and he had not been able to find out anything about his son. The old man said to the little boy: "My little grandson! You see that a long time has already gone by. I'm going to give you some good advice, but be cunning: sneak around unobserved in the other people's huts and listen carefully to what they say. Maybe you'll be able to find out something about your father. Possibly they've killed him or some other accident has befallen him. Who knows how and when and where. But be cunning so that no one will notice what you are up to! You can also lie down on a bed in another hut, at night when it gets dark, and pretend to be asleep. Listen carefully to what the people are saying! Then, in the morning come to my hut and tell me what you heard. But be cunning when you do so!" "All right," said the boy, "I'll be clever and do as you've told me." </p>
<p>He went unnoticed into the hut of his mother's relatives, sat down by the fire, and played. The sisters-in-law of the man they had left on the island had gone out on the ocean at sunset to fish with torches in the dark. They did not return until late. When they entered the hut they did not know that the little boy had crawled under the hides. They immediately sat down by the fire, for although they had had a fire in the canoe, they were very cold. One of them said: "How cold it is tonight; although we had a fire in the canoe we were terribly cold!" To this the other replied: "But how do you think that conceited braggart is feeling whom we left on the island without anything at all? He doesn't even have a fire; he must be trembling terribly with cold." The other sister-in- law said: "He well deserved it. Why does he always want to be the best and the most clever!" The cunning grandson heard all this because he was not asleep and was well hidden. </p>
<p>The following morning he got up from the bed and acted quite unconcerned. Not until then did the two sisters-in-law realize that the little boy had slept there. Soon he went and sat outside by the entrance of the hut, for the sun was shining warmly. His grandfather watched him from his own hut. After some time he called to him loudly: "Where are you hiding, my little grandson? Oh, now I see you! You're sitting there in front of your aunts' hut. Come here a minute! I'll pick the lice off you again, for you always have lots of them on your head. Come quickly now!" The little boy got up and went to his grandfather's hut. He squatted very close to him so that he was able to whisper into his ear imperceptibly, and the grandfather acted as though he was picking lice from his head. The little boy told him that the night before <pb n="157"/>his father's two sisters-in-law had not returned from fishing until late, that they had been very cold although they had a fire in the canoe, but that their brother-in-law there on the island probably was shivering terribly with cold and frost since they had left him behind without anything, even without fire, as punishment for his having wanted always to be the best and the most clever. The old man said: "Now I understand everything!" </p>
<p>Quickly he began to peel off bark and built himself a canoe. He loaded a lot of firewood on board. After this he took a burning piece of wood from his hearth and made a fire with it in the new canoe. He then said to the other people: "I'm going to the eternal island which never disappears! If I like it there I'll stay." The others said: "What strange ideas this old man has! What's he going to do on that island? Who knows whether someone hasn't finally told him that we deserted his son there in order to play a trick on him." And one of those two sisters-in-law said to the other: "Do you remember? That night when we came back from fishing, the old man's grandson must have overheard what we were saying: then he told his grandfather everything." The old man took a few relatives with him and they all went to the island. </p>
<p>In his distress the man who had been left on the island had begun to tame a few birds, for after all he had nothing to eat. The tame birds in their turn attracted other birds so that he was able to obtain enough meat and did not die of hunger. </p>
<p>When the old man arrived at the island with his canoe he got out. He thought: "I wonder how I'm going to find my son here? Where can he be? This island is so big! Maybe he has already died of hunger and cold." Then he saw a lot of bird droppings on the ground and said to himself: "Maybe my son has tamed these birds for himself." He felt the droppings; they were cold so he continued walking. Then he again felt the bird droppings on the ground and noticed that they were warmer. So he said to himself: "My son must be around here!" He continued walking in the direction where the bird droppings became warmer and warmer. When he touched them again and found them to be soft and warm he said to himself: "My son must be here!" He walked yet a little farther and soon heard loud snoring. Joyfully he said: "That's my son snoring!" He walked up to him and shook him awake. The latter became very frightened, got up cautiously, and suddenly went for the old man's throat, for he thought someone wanted to kill him. Quickly the old man said: "Take a good look: I'm your father! Don't be frightened!" Then the son recognized his father and was very happy to see him there. Soon he told him how all the others had deserted him, how he <pb n="158"/>had been able to save his life only with great difficulty, and how much he had suffered without fire. The father comforted him. Soon they got into the canoe and went back to the camp. </p>
<p>Before they reached shore and got out the man said to his father: "I'm going to stay in the canoe a bit longer. But you can call all the people together and invite them to our hut; entertain them for a long time. Then I'll leave the canoe, sneak up to the hut, and scrape away the earth from outside so that all the poles will become loose and shaky. But you must keep talking to the people. When I'm finished with my task I'll secretly give you a sign; then run out quickly because the hut will collapse and kill everybody inside." </p>
<p>The two now did exactly that. The old man called the people together and everyone came to his hut. Here he spoke with them for a long time. But meanwhile on the outside his son was loosening the ground where the hut was standing. Soon he signaled his father, and the latter quickly came out. Then the whole hut collapsed and crushed everybody inside. Anyone that tried to escape was killed by the two. This is how all those who had left Martúwux-yélluwa on the island perished, including his own wife. </p>
<p>But today Túwux is much appreciated; he is very popular among the people, because his call always announces an imminent visit, the [visitor's] canoe coming from the direction whence he comes flying.<note>My informants had a discussion in which they expressed their opinions of this story. All agreed: "The punishment was very just for those people who had left that man on the island without anything. But he, too, had to have his punishment, as he was a conceited braggart and a troublesome know-it-all."</note> </p>
