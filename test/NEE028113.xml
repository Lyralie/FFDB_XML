<p>He! ... I lived in my village. Every year I went to the forest to hunt. Tens of he[-bears], - six tens, - I brought [home]. Ah! it was splendid! In the past years, tens of she[-bears], - six tens - did I bring home. I was luckier in [my] hunting than any other man: I brought more home. </p>
<p>That day, I went out a-hunting. Ah! it was splendid! I went farther on the hunting-path than [I did] every day. I went, though I saw no [game], I went yet further. At the end of my road, there was a noise. I looked - Ah! it was splendid! - a man dressed in black silk garments, and a man dressed in red silk garments were fighting. </p>
<p><pb n="169"/>The former, the man dressed in black silk garments, was undermost. After some time, the man dressed in red silk garments was undermost. When he saw [me] the man dressed in black silk garments fixed his eyes on me. The man dressed in black silk garments, when he had fixed his eyes, said: - Ah! was splendid! - "Man of Turupa, what hast thou come to do? Owing to thee, I now give myself for thee. </p>
<p>In thy absence, this god quarrelled [with me]; and instead of thee, I give myself. In former times, in the forest village of Turupa [there] were many people. All are dead, and they are not. Thou alone livest; because he has seen thy body, then I having heard, again have come to thee. Afterwards the gods quarrelled, and I give myself for thee. </p>
<p>If I myself am harmed, then indeed for thee will it not be well. And therefore flee". Having heard, I had a feeling of terror. After [this], I fled. Having fled a little, I returned [saying]: "If in any village they hear of me, they will grin maliciously at me". </p>
<p><pb n="170"/>A very malign thought I had [then]; and so came I to the spot where this fight was [taking place]. Again a man dressed in silk garment, quite black, saw me. "Man of Rurupa, escape [more] swiftly!" When I looked, at that moment he cast down the man dressed in black silk garments, a senseless corpse. </p>
<p>At the same time, the man dressed in red silk garments fixed [his] eyes on me. - Ah! it was splendid! - and came after me. Therefore, being affrighted, with rapid flight I ran away. The man dressed in red silk garments came after me. To the edges of the path did he stretch his wings. His upper jaw touched the clouds, his lower jaw touched the earth. </p>
<p>I ran [along] almost in the mouth of [that monstrous] deity. So I held out the sharp [point] of a dagger [of which the hilt was] inlaid with bone, [and] into the mouth of that god I went, white-heeled [and barefoot]. I [entered] the belly of the god, and slowly turned the dagger; quickly I seized [it], slowly I turned [it]. On [my] way [inside] of the god, waving [my] little hand, I upheaved myself. </p>
<p><pb n="171"/>When I had looked, behind [me on] the way, this great god [lay] a senseless corpse; I cast him [from me]. Much pleased, with my dagger inlaid with bone I cut his flesh off. To all insects also, to the trees also, to all did I deal [it] out. Having done [this] I went back to my house. Living in my house, fearing nothing. I lived. </p>
<p>From the gods all the village [people] heard about me; the men that heard admired. I lived having great satisfaction. Now I lived well.</p>
