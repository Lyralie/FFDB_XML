<p>Once Bongso went hunting. He caught a monitor lizard. He also found some ripe palm heart (bayœz). He returned home with his catch and cooked the monitor lizard. The bayœz fruit, however, he placed on the shelf above the fire on the ground. He ate the monitor lizard but forgot all about the fruit. The next day he went hunting again. Suddenly he remembered the bayœz fruit he had found the day before. "What did I do with the bayœz fruit?" he asked himself. "Oh yes, I remember, I put it on the shelf above the fire." But he was going on a long hunting trip and he did not return home for more than a month- Finally, one day he did go home. He cooked the meat he had caught and then lay down and went to sleep. When he woke the next morning he saw a woman lying next to him on the mat. "Who are you?" he asked her. "I am the bayœz fruit you left on the shelf above the fire some time ago," she replied. Bongso and the bayœz woman became husband and wife and lived together. </p>
<p>Bongso lived alone some distance from his parents. One day his mother decided to visit him. She walked to his house, but Bongso had gone hunting. She sat on the ladder leading up to the house and looked inside. Then she returned to her own house and told her husband, "Our child has got a wife." She had seen a woman's loin-cloth inside Bongso's house. The next day she returned to Bongso's house. She went very early in the morning and Bongso and his wife were still asleep when she arrived. She placed herself on the ladder and said to her son, "You have a wife, Bongso?" "No, I live on my own," lied Bongso. "I came here yesterday and saw a woman's loin-cloth inside your house," insisted the mother. So Bongso admitted that he did in fact have a wife. "Where did you meet her?" the mother wanted to know. "Oh, I just met her in the jungle," replied Bongso. He did not want his mother to know that his wife was a bayœz fruit woman. The mother returned to her husband, but after a while she went to live with Bongso and her daughter-in-law. </p>
<p>One day Bongso was out hunting. The daughter-in-law was picking lice out of her mother-in-law's hair: When she had finished, the mother-in-law wanted to pick the lice out the hair of her daughter-in-law. "I don't want you to," she said. The mother-in-law insisted, however, saying, "You have picked my lice, now it is my turn to pick yours." So the girl let her do it. While she was doing it she came across several thorns at the back of the other's neck. "You have some thorns on your neck," she said to her daughter-in-law, "I'll pull them out." "No, no, don't do it." But the mother-in-law took no notice of the girl's protestations and pulled them out. Immediately she had done so her daughter-in-law turned into a true bayœz fruit tree. She could no longer be a woman. </p>
<p>When Bongso returned in the evening he had not caught any game. "Where is my wife?" he asked his mother. She told him, "When I was picking lice out of her hair I came across some thorns which I wanted to pull out. She would not let me do it, but I did it anyway, and then she turned into that bayœz tree over there." <pb n="38"/>When Bongso heard this he turned into a jòg tree [another fruit tree]. </p>
<p>The mother returned to her husband. If she had not gone against her daughter-in-law's wishes her son would not have turned into a jòg tree nor her daughter-in law into a bayœz tree. </p>
