<p>Once five brothers were living together in the hut of their brother-in-law. But the brother-in-law was an evil and dangerous person. The most disagreeable thing was that he was disgustingly stingy, for however much meat he had available he always gave his brothers-in-law only a little bit. Usually he went hunting by himself. In the forest, near the beach, he would light a big fire and try to kill the birds that sat on the beach. </p>
<p>One day the eldest of the five brothers had gone out to hunt birds and had unintentionally taken the same route as had his evil brother-in-law. The latter, meanwhile, had sat down on a steep hill and was warming himself by the fire. Soon this bad man discovered his brother-in-law approaching in his direction. He then made his murderous plan to kill his unsuspecting brother-in-law. From the forest he <pb n="141"/>quickly fetched a sturdy hašamáif,<note>A branch from the beech tree with a protruding growth, caused by the Cyttaria fungus; cf. Gusinde 1937:34, fig. 8; 554, fig. 66. This wood is exceedingly hard and it serves prominently as a club.</note> which he pushed into the fire. When the eldest of the five brothers got close his malevolent brother-in- law said to him: "Make yourself comfortable here by the fire and warm yourself." He even helped him sit down and gently turned him around so that the latter was facing away from the fire, as if to warm his back first; all the while the unsuspecting man was looking down from the high, steep hill. Surreptitiously the evil man reached for the burning hašamáif, pulled it out of the fire, brought it down on the head of his brother-in-law, and cried out: "Look out, my brother-in-law, a big hašamáif is falling; save yourself!" Before the unsuspecting man could turn aside the hašamáif had dealt him a blow that cracked his head; he died on the spot. The evil man had put the hašamáif into the fire so that his brother-in-law should not be able to save himself by grabbing it and warding it off, for nobody dares take a burning cudgel in his hand. Then he gave the body of his brother-in-law a powerful kick and it rolled down. </p>
<p>Some time later the second eldest brother went out to look for his brother who had not returned. Finally he met his brother-in-law who was still sitting on the same hill warming himself. Unsuspectingly he went toward him. He let that evil man persuade him to sit down by the fire. Here he was killed in the same way as his brother before him. Then his body too rolled down. Not long afterward the third brother set off, for his two elder brothers had still not returned and he wanted to look for them. Soon the fourth brother, too, went out to search. Indeed, these two were killed by this terrible brother-in-law in the same way as their two elder brothers. That way only the youngest brother was left. </p>
<p>He had been waiting for a long time, impatiently repeating: "I wonder where my four brothers can be? They've been gone a long time and none has come back. Could they have met with an accident?" Then finally he, too, went out to look for them. But he was shrewd and more careful than his brothers. Like them he started up the hill at the top of which his brother-in-law was sitting by the fire. Down at the foot of the hill he saw several bodies; they looked as though they had rolled down from the top. He said to himself in alarm: "I wonder if those are the bodies of my brothers whom someone has killed?"<note>It should be noted that the man did not go right up to the bodies, partly out of fear, partly out of aversion.</note> Slowly he climbed up the hill. At the top he met his brother-in-law who was sitting by the <pb n="142"/>fire. The latter had already put a thick hašamáif into the fire to make it red hot. Right away he invited his brother-in-law: "Sit down by the fire here and rest comfortably. First warm your back and while you're doing that you can look down." But he replied: "I might get burned." To this the malevolent brother-in-law said: "Why are you so worried? Look at me, I even like to sit by the fire that way." So saying he sat down by the fire as though to warm his back, keeping his face turned away from the fire. He only wanted to allay the fear of his brother-in-law so that afterward the latter would follow his example. The youngest brother had already looked into the fire and seen the thick glowing hašamáif. While the evil man kept his face turned away from the fire he seized the hašamáif, pulled it quickly from the fire, swung it, and brought it down on his unsuspecting brother-in-law. The glowing hašamáif smashed his head and he died on the spot. Thus this man took revenge on his degenerate brother-in-law for the murder of his brothers. </p>
