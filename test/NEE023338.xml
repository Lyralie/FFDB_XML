<p>Once a star came down from the sky. She went to Bongso's house. They slept together and became man and wife. The next day Bongso went hunting. His wife wanted binturong. He shot one and brought it home, where the wife cooked and ate it. The following day he went hunting again and this time his wife accompanied him. They passed a rotten tree full of maggots. The wife asked Bongso to kill the maggots, but he said that to eat maggots is dirty (<ref target="g:GEE2143.019">kama</ref>), and he would not touch them. The wife caught the maggots, built a fire, and roasted them. Then she ate the maggot fat. Bongso would not eat any. In the evening they returned home, and went to sleep. In the night the wife became very hot. She went to sit in the doorway. "Oh my body is so hot," she complained.<note>Heat is used metaphorically to indicate a fire transformation from on state to another (as the heat of fire transforms raw into cooked). See also "The man who became tiger" in part IIIB.</note> She went down on the ground and ran around. Bongso followed her. "You must burn down the house," she told Bongso. Since he wanted to help her, he set fire to his house. The wife went into the smoke. He could see her above the house in the smoke. "I do not want you, and you do not want me," she said to Bongso, and then she returned home to the sky using the smoke as her path. </p>
