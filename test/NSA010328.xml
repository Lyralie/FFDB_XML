<p>Once [in the olden days] several families had their camp in the eastern corner of Bahía Ušuáia. When they heard that a whale had beached in the west, three of their men got into a canoe and departed in a westerly direction. Two of them were yékamuš, the third one was not. Those two were Héšpul<note>Taeniptera pyrope, a small sparrow of the Tyrannidae family. It plays an important part in other stories as a mythological personage.</note> and Yookalía.<note>Milvago chimango, the sparrow hawk.</note> Their canoe was extremely fast. Rapidly it went past Puerto Olla.<note>This small harbor is situated on the north shore exactly opposite Punta Divide; thus it lies on the borderline between the central and western Yamana groups.</note> Farther and farther their canoe advanced until they reached Hapananúši,<note>The waterways west of the Darwin Channel as far as the last projecting arm of the Brecknock Peninsula. In the parlance of the central and eastern Yamana the inhabitants of this remote region are known as "Halakwulup."</note> a place inhabited by the Halakwulup, a dangerous, evil folk. The three Yamana saw the huts of these people, left their canoe, and went ashore. The two yékamuš were invited into one hut; the third man was called into another.<note>It was the deliberate intent of those evil people to separate the three visitors from one another in order to be able to overpower them more easily individually.</note> When the two yékamuš entered the hut all the children there cheered exultantly. They shouted loudly: "Yárum káiya, quickly now!" That means [in their language]: 'We want to eat these two at once!' But the older people replied: "Hamašúnna, not until tomorrow!" </p>
<p>The two yékamuš soon grasped the meaning of these words. One of them also saw how a woman surreptitiously cut off part of her breast and put it on the glowing charcoal to roast, for she wanted to invite those two to eat. Héšpul became very upset at this. He pulled the piece of flesh from the fire and threw it out of the hut in a wide arc. Then he said furiously: "I didn't come here to eat human flesh!" He took his yékuš and cut off a piece of whale meat, which he put on the glowing embers. Thick smoke was formed which caused the people in the hut to fall asleep, for he was a yékamuš.<note>With his supernatural knowledge as shaman he deliberately made his adversaries harmless in this way.</note> All the people, even the snapping dogs, were overcome by a profound sleep. </p>
<p>Now Héšpul said to his companion who was sitting next to him: "We'll see quickly which pieces of blubber are the best. These we'll put aside for ourselves!" They looked around, cut out the best parts of blubber and the nicest pieces of meat for themselves, and carried them <pb n="176"/>to their canoe. Soon their canoe was filled to the top and they hurriedly departed. They paddled diligently and kept going all night until they got to Asúsiwaia early in the morning. </p>
<p>As they went past this small harbor they heard the Halakwulup hurl big rocks after them with their slings. Each stone that fell caused a loud crash. The three Yamana threw many pieces of blubber into the water to lighten the canoe and to advance more rapidly. They paddled with all their might and soon reached Ušuáia. Here they noticed that the Halakwulup had been unable to get close to them after all, and had since turned back. From then on Héšpul stayed in Ušuáia. </p>
<p>The Halakwulup sat down together and decided: "The three Yamana men came here to kill us; they took our meat and escaped into their territory. Now we'll build a very large hut and provide for ourselves. Afterward we'll build a long canoe and alone, without the women, we shall go to the Yamana, to capture, and kill them." Thus began the čiéxaus. From the Halakwulup it later came to the Yamana.<note>It was there in the west that Halakwulup and Yamana came into contact. From the former the latter learned the puberty rites which in time also came to be adopted among the central and eastern Yamana.</note> </p>
<p>To imitate what the Halakwulup had planned, the Yamana catch live birds and bring them into the Big Hut where they leave them.<note>This custom is not taken too seriously. It is more the fancy of some participant or other to catch a bird and thus meet the demands of that custom.</note> These birds remind one of the Yamana whom the Halakwulup had intended to capture. </p>
