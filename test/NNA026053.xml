<p>Toad monsters of gigantic size lived at one time in the country. They lived partly under water, and partly under ground. Their breath came out trough holes and cracks in the mountains. They lay concealed, having their bodies covered with water, mud, or earth. When people came alone, they opened their huge mouths and swallowed them. They lived by eating people and animals. Raven wanted to deprive these monsters of their power, because they killed people. </p>
<p>He went to the abode of one, and sat down beside him. He said, "Brother-in-law, my mother told me that my uncle swallowed people, but I don't believe it. I don't think there is anyone that swallows people." Toad said at once, "It is only I who swallow people." Raven said, "That is strange. How do you do it?" Toad said, "I will show you. I will swallow you." Raven said, "All right!" and when Toad opened his mouth, Raven jumped in quickly, before he had time to bite. </p>
<p>Raven killed him by cutting his insides. When he was dead, Raven wandered around seeking for a place to get out. At last he saw a small hole through which a ray of light was gleaming. It appeared very high and far away. He climbed and climbed, the hole appearing to get larger as he got closer. At last he saw the sky through it, and finally he emerged on the top of a mountain. He had come out through <pb n="222"/>Toad's breathing-hole [or nostril]. Raven said, "Now I have killed one of you. All of you have now lost your power of killing people." </p>
