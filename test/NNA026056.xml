<p>Raven met two men<note>It seems, these men were red-willow trees.</note> who were wearing robes of red-willow bark. He thought the robes looked very pretty, and he wondered how he could fool the men so as to obtain their blankets. "Oh!" he said, "I will steal them from them when they are asleep." Now, with Raven and the ancients, one night was the same as one winter, and one day the same as a summer. He went at night to steal the robes of the Red-Willow men, but found they were awake, and that their robes could not be stolen. They were fast to their flesh, in the same way as bark is to trees in the wintertime. They slept in the daytime, which was the same as summer, when the bark of trees is loose. He peeled off their robes carefully while they were sleeping, and ran away with them. </p>
<p>He came to a lake, where he threw away his own robe. North-Wind took it down the lake out of sight. He put on the red-willow bark robes; but they were brittle and broke up, and wore out in less than a day. The bark of the red willow was very thick in those days; but, probably because Raven wore the blankets out, the bark is now thin. Now Raven was sorry he had thrown away his own robe. He called to South-Wind to blow, knowing he would blow back the robe; but there was no answer. Then he dressed himself in pretty clothes, and put fine feathers in his hair. He danced and sang, and asked South-Wind to come to a feast and see him dance. Soon he saw a black cloud advancing, and he knew that the wind was coming. He <pb n="224"/>saw that the wind was bringing the robe. He caught it and hid it. The main body of the wind was a little behind. When it arrived, Raven said, "I am too lame to dance, my leg is sore." </p>
<p>He made a sweat-house, and asked South-Wind to sweat with him. He said, "I have no covering for the sweat-house. Have you no blankets?"<note>Compare p. 230; also Thompson (MAFLS 2 : 9); also RBAE 31 : 732 and MAFLS 2 : 21.</note> Wind answered, "Yes, we brought a blanket with us. We will give it to you to use." South-Wind searched for the robe, but could not find it. Wind refused to sweat with Raven, saying it was too hot. Raven pretended to be angry, and called the wind "bad people." Wind answered, "You asked us to a feast and dance, and now there is nothing." Raven said, "I am sick, and that is why I ask you to sweat with me, but you refuse. You South-Wind people are used to heat." South-Wind said, "Yes, we South-Wind people come from a warm country; but we ourselves are cool, and do not like to make ourselves hot. We cannot sweat." Raven said, "You promised me a covering for my sweat-houses, and now you have told me a lie." South-Wind said, "Perhaps the robe has gone back to our house." Raven told him, "Well, you had better go back and find it." </p>
<p>When the South-Wind people had departed, Raven danced and called North-Wind to blow strong. North-Wind came, blowing a gale, and blew the South-Wind people far away. This is why, when a south wind comes up, it blows only a short time before a north wind springs up and blows it back. The North-Wind people are stronger than the South-Wind people. Had Raven not acted as he did, but entertained the South-Wind people, and had he not asked North- Wind to blow them away, then in this country we should now have mild winds nearly all the time, instead of the cold winds we generally have. </p>
