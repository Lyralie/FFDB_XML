<head>NEE028168</head>
<p>The land of Turupa was [a] very good [hunting ground]. Every one of the former years tens of he-bears, - six <pb n="214"/>tens, - did they bring home. Every one of the former years, tens of she-bears - six tens - did they bring home. But now, at the [other] end of the district, there was the god of the mountains. At the tail of the mountains was the land of the foxes, of the [more] ancient gods. [A Bear speaks here]. "That day I listened. I beard that the foxes had made a design, that a man of Near-Turupa should go [to visit] a man of Far-Rurupa. </p>
<p>Therefore I talked to myself with various thoughts: 'Every season the man of Near-Turupa sends great bundles of 'inaus' [as offerings]; he offers 'inaus' unto me, making order in the years; and therefore when, - refreshing myself in my turn, being thankful to the man of Near-Turupa, - I give my people instead of myself, [he] with fervour prepares bundles of 'inaus' for me; [this] alone did I say to myself. </p>
<p>The wife of the man of Near-Turupa, though [being] a woman, [daughter] of man, [being] a woman having a most beautiful face, [she] gives me offerings of food, much vegetable <pb n="215"/>food. Therefore I being very thankful, now if the elder gods shall come to that woman, this world of day will give no [more] beams. Thus thought I of this. </p>
<p>Afterwards I made ready [to go out]. I took an old kerchief, and put [it] on my head, I placed it on my head. An old weapon did I stick in my girdle. Having finished, I made [to] myself the skin [and exterior] of a man. Slowly I rose, [and] went into the courtyard. On the way I [am wont to] go, slowly on the way, when I went imitating the gait of the wealthy man, I came to the house of Near Turupa. </p>
<p>Now I arrived at a path through the sand [of the shore]. On the way, on the way that led to the great house of the man of Near-Turupa, I went slowly, [even] as the man of Near-Turupa walked, having taken the appearance of an old man. Now I came to the door. Through the door. Through the door I entered the house. I looked in front of me. When I looked, [I saw her to be] a fair renowned woman, [from whose] truly beaming face, a face like [the face of] a goddess <pb n="216"/>from whose face came forth beams, and spread throughout the house ... the house of a [mortal] man. </p>
<p>I being a god full of love, felt a yearning towards her. Various thoughts I revolved withim myself. The mistress of the house looked upon me, smiling a little; she hung her head, and spoke thus: "I thought that thou wast [even] now going far away. How hast thou come [back] so quickly home?" Thus speaking, she made place [for me]. Having come near the spot [where she was sitting], with a deep breath I let myself drop into the place of the master of the house. Taking off the old man's kerchief I let it fall on the floor. Though from the odour of man my soul had become heavy, [yet] I controlled myself. The mistress of the house, having risen, gave me to eat of the soup [prepared] for the weary. Directly afterwards, someone entered the courtyard; through the door there came in two wealthy men [apparently, but indeed] gods clad alike in red silk dresses; they stared at me [and] showed their tongues. </p>
<p>Having walked [in] further, they unrolled their mats [and seated themselves] along the back wall, [and] all partook of my soup, [prepared] for the weary. Having done, these men-foxes said to the mistress of the house: "Thou being <pb n="217"/>a woman, give us to eat of any vegetable thou hast". So then that mortal woman cooked stalks of the plant axturi. Having bit off pieces of hard roe [preparing it], she helped [each of] the men-foxes to a heaped-up vessel. </p>
<p>Me also did she help [to some]. Having stooped forward over my food, I ate. And at times, with the tail of my eye, I looked at the men-foxes. The men-foxes, choosing [the intervals] between my glances, stealthily raised their hind-paws to scratch their gums with their claws. They stealthily put their saliva, mixed with blood, through the chinks of the framework of the fire-place. Though I saw, I did as if I had not seen, and ate. Having done eating, I gave my vessel to the mistress of the house; she put it aside. </p>
<p>Having done, though I was loth, I forced myself to talk, <pb n="218"/>and I added laughter; I endeavoured [to make] the men-foxes sit by my side. When it was dark, the mistress of the house made the beds. The man-fox guests went to the beds for guests, [and] lay down. The mistress, put together the ember-stumps into the ashes. Haying done, she lay down upon her bed. </p>
<p>I likewise, though my soul was heavy by [reason of] the odour of man, still having compassion on the soul of the mortal woman, undid my girdle and going [to her] covered her with the skirts of my fur. Those men-foxes fell asleep, with wide-spread snores they slept. The mortal woman likewise slept well. So I rose and cut off the ends of the ears of both the foxes. </p>
<p>Having placed [these] between that woman's breasts and afterwards having gone out on the hunting path of the man of Turupa, on that path did I turn into a great bear. Unable to pass through the narrow spaces between the forest trees, [and] choosing the wider spaces, I went along: to my house did I go. Afterwards, the next day at dawn, there was a cry in Foxland, as of those rejoicing [to have got] a wife. </p>
<p>When I listened, "There are [but] ear-tips [here!]" thus I heard. - Thus did the foxes talk now: "The man <pb n="219"/>of Rurupa has indeed a powerful god, and is stronger in magic might than we are". Thus they spoke. Whatever they might do, they would achieve nothing. After this, they would no [longer] love mortal men. Thus they spoke together. [But] if they could find a "Sumarima", a being like them, and if they should go [to the men], [it would be] well. </p>
<p>I heard them speaking together thus. Afterwards, once more, I heard from the birds about the man of Turupa. He gave me new [marks of] gratitude. Owing to there being a god, though the foxes in guise of men had tried to take his wife - owing to there being a god, he was [still able] to have himself fed by his wife. Every year he made many fresh gifts [to me]; therefore I have evolved myself into a new god. </p>
<p>Thankful to a mortal man, I in my turn have become <pb n="220"/>a protector to the man of Turupa. Now therefore, the man of Rurupa has had a daughter, a son - two offsprings. The man educated the son, the woman educated the daughter. When they had the look of old people, they bent down each to one side, and died. Afterwards, the man who followed [his father] was more prosperous than any other rich man; they said that he ordered men to seek news in secret about himself. From the beginning this land of Turupa alone was a land wherein rich men dwelt". </p>
