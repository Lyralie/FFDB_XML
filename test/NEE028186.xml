<head>NEE028186</head>
<p>I was a little boy. I lived with my two elder brothers. When they went hunting every season, they killed the deer-creatures. They reared me only on the flesh of deer. [Thus] doing, did my brothers go one year, hunting, as [they had done] before, after [alone], did I remain. Remaining in the house [alone], suddenly as I sat, a thought somehow [arose within <pb n="200"/>me]. "What then [can] my brothers have in that pile in this angle of the house?" I wanted to see. </p>
<p>Wanting to see, I uncovered the pile of my brothers. Having uncovered, [there] was such a thing. There was to be seen an old box. I untied the cords that box had been tied with; I opened the lid. When I had opened, it was full of precious things heaped together: bars of gold, bars of silver [there were], [and] I took [and] I saw. When I saw, then I knew what was in the pile in the angle of the house. </p>
<p>Knowing [this], I wanted to see what things were [at the bottom of] the pile, in the very angle. Wanting to see, I took out a whole box[-ful] of precious things. At the bottom of the box, such things [there] were: a long gold knife and a long silver knife: together [there] were two. Which having seen, I knew that to be really what my brothers had in the pile in the angle. Having known, [and] having taken the golden knife and the silver knife, I broke to pieces all the goodly precious things. </p>
<p><pb n="201"/>Afterwards, having taken the golden knife [and] the silver knife, and placing them in my girdle, I went out. When I went out, [I saw] the way by the house [that went] to the forest. On [that] way I went. As I went, a great mountain was [to be seen]. At the foot of the mountain arriving, I looked round. As I looked, [I saw] an old little hut with a point, ed roof, in the forest of the valley of the river.</p>
<p>As it stood with [its] pointed roof, I went into the courtyard. When I arrived and listened, I heard as the sound of my sleeping brothers, snoring. Though I wanted to go in, remembering that I had broken all [those] goodly precious things of my elder brothers. I being ashamed, and unable to enter my brothers' [hut], remained standing in the courtyard [outside] the hut. Standing [as] I remained, time came to the end of the day. </p>
<p>When the day's end came, and it was dusk, I would [fain] go in, yet I thought still more that I had behaved badly; and being ashamed [of that] before my brothers, thinking <pb n="202"/>only of that, until darkness I remained standing outside. Remaining, as I listened, there was a sound of some one more coming from the forest, in the valley of the river some one running towards the hut. As I looked, a he-wolf, a she-wolf - a couple of wolves, - arrived beside the hut. </p>
<p>The he-wolf stood up, placing his paws under his chin at the right corner of the house. The she-wolf stood up, placing her paws likewise under her chin at the left corner of the house: as if [they were] awaiting some one. As I looked, I had a feeling of terror. Though I had [it], [yet] still more ashamed before my brothers, although I wished to enter, [yet] not doing so, I remained outside the hut. </p>
<p>Remaining as before, I listened. As I listened, there was a sound as of some one coming, from one end of the [range of] mountains. When he came, and when he walked on hard ground; iririn-tyrin! - When he walked upon soft ground: ichakan ichakaj≈õe! - Such was the sound of his walking. Hearing that, I remained struck with a feeling of <pb n="203"/>terror. As I remained so, now [this being] came beside the hut. As I looked. I saw a large bear had come beside the hut. </p>
<p>When he had come beside the hut, close to the spot where I was standing, he stood up. placing his paws under his chin. After that, as I remained so, I had a feeling of still greater terror. Such being [the case], as I listened [I heard] some one coming, and the sound - as before - of one going through the forest. As I heard, it was the sound of one within the forest. And now, the sound as it were came nearer. </p>
<p>When the sound took place, and when I listened, somebeing [like] a monstrous devil [whom] I knew not, [whose] upper jaw touched the clouds, [and whose] lower touched the earth, made [that] sound [in] going [along]. When he stepped on dry twigs, the noise of the breaking [was]: "Chkaorototo"; when he stepped on green twigs, the noise of their springing back was: "Mausurasane". When I heard [that], I had fear in my mind. </p>
<p><pb n="204"/>Having fear in my mind, [and] wishing to go in, wishing to wake my elder brothers, but [being] yet more ashamed in my soul before my brothers, I remained standing now outside the hut. As I remained, the sound of that devil who approached drew yet nearer to the hut. [That] being [so], I heard the voice of the breath of the great bear [standing] beside [me]: </p>
<p>"Child of Rurupa, surely this devil is no common devil. That not being [so], the sleep of thy elder brothers is also no common sleep. This monstrous devil has made them to sleep thus. [That] being so, these two wolves, these, are the guardians of thy elder brothers, the wealthy men of Turupa. </p>
<p>Therefore, the guardians are ready to save thy elder brothers. However, I think that the guardians too will be unable to help. Now, I am the god of the beginning of the hills. I too live looking forward to meet the 'inaus' cut out, <pb n="205"/>the 'inaus' covered with shavings, by thy brothers, [those] wealthy men of Turupa. And therefore I have come to save [these] Turupan wealthy men. </p>
<p>Yet I too think I shall be unable. And therefore thou alone, if thou quickly shalt return to thy home, [it will be] well". Thus I heard the voice of the large bear's breath. Having heard, I feared yet more. Though I would [fain] have fled, - yet, having broken all those various precious things in my elder brothers' absence, I would not flee and leave my elder brothers now. </p>
<p>So thinking, having a very strong feeling of terror, nevertheless I remained notionless. I remaining [so], at last that devil arrived behind the hut. What was it? I knew not: a god or a devil? a very great devil. Though its head was [just] behind the hut, still there was in the forest the rustle [of its body]. [Its] upper jaw touched the clouds; its lower jaw touched the ground. Thus it went behind the house. </p>
<p><pb n="206"/>Meanwhile the he-wolf and the she-wolf pawed the air behind the hut; thus doing, they went to [meet] this devil. Afterwards, [these] beings fought with each other. When [these] beings fought, [and] whilst they were fighting the whole night, [long] some one fell, [as it were] a stone that had fallen. As I looked [I saw] the two wolves, cut exactly in halves, lay dead behind the hut. </p>
<p>After [this], that monstrous devil came [round one] side of the hut. Then the god of the beginning of the hills, that large bear, likewise pawed the air and went. With a loud cry the [two] beings went one towards other. Also did [these] beings fight together all night. Whilst the beings were fighting, some one fell; [as it were] a stone that had fallen at the side of the hut. When I looked [I saw] that large bear, [cut] exactly in halves, lying by the side of the hut. </p>
<p>When I looked, I had a feeling of terror. At last this devil made ready to go in at the door of the hut, and came not to me. Then taking out the golden knife [I had] put in <pb n="207"/>my girdle, I raised it to strike. Having raised it to strike, I cut through the monster's] neck: [I] having cut through its neck, [its] head alone attacked me. I raised the silver knife to strike. The upper part of the body [then] attacked me. </p>
<p>When the upper part of the body attacked me, again I raised the golden knife to strike. The lower part of the body attacked me; again I cut at the lower part of the body. At last I quite slew that devil. Afterwards, with the golden knife and with the silver knife, I cut the devil in pieces. Having cut him in pieces, - cut him all in pieces - I gave all of him to the grass and to the trees and to the birds. </p>
<p>Thus did I make even that devil's shadow to be no [more]. Having done [so], as I listened, I thought that, since [there] had been all night the noise of the fight with such a devil, my brothers [must have] heard; nevertheless, I thought they heard not. Whilst they slept [just] the same, the noise of their snorings twain was as if they were chasing flies; <pb n="208"/>[those] two, sleeping and snoring [made] a [great] noise. </p>
<p>Having heard [this] I went out of the yard into the house. Running did I go on my way to the house. Having entered the house, I sat, with the bearing of one who has gone nowhere. [As I was] sitting there, when the end of the day came, I heard the noise of my brothers coming along the road, and speaking of something. When I heard, [it was] the voice of the younger of my elder brothers, speaking thus, I heard the voice: </p>
<p>"When even [our] guardians and the god, the bear, had been killed, who was it that saved us? [To what is it] owing that we live now?" Such voice of conversation did I hear. The younger of my elder brothers said: "A little way off, there, further in the forest, in the middle of the road, in a soft place, I have seen one footmark of our little boy, brought up by us who was running". Such was the voice of him that spoke. </p>
<p><pb n="209"/>My eldest brother did not believe [and said]: "Such [mighty] gods! and yet they have all been slain. [If] so, our little boy ... how could he know how to save [us]?" They did not believe; I heard their voices as they came. Though I heard I sat with the bearing of one that had gone nowhere. At last my brothers, my two brothers, came in at the door. </p>
<p>Whilst entering, and when in the house, they, speaking of that alone, sat. "Who, such [a one], has saved us? To what do we owe our being now alive?" They sat talking aside. I, though I heard, [yet] I sat with the bearing of one that had gone nowhere, and with bearing of understanding nothing. Sitting, I thought, [that] though I should not say, [yet] they would discover me, that I had broken [those things] in the corner [of the room]; if I should say, it would be all one. </p>
<p>So I told [them] openly. "Then, when my elder brothers went out hunting, I had in [their] absence such a thought. Wanting to see what it really was that my brothers had piled <pb n="210"/>in a corner, I uncovered the pile. When I opened [it], there lay various goodly precious things and goodly swords. Whilst I looked, wishing to look into the very bottom of the pile, I took out things, and all goodly swords, the goodly precious things that were in the box. </p>
<p>At the very bottom of the pile there were two such things: a golden knife and a silver knife: these two things did I see. Having seen, I knew that they were at the bottom of the pile. Afterwards, - I meant not to do thus - all the goodly precious swords and goodly precious things did I knock to pieces; all the precious things did I break. Afterwards, when I went out on the way that you went, on the way you went hunting went I. </p>
<p>As I went, I arrived at your hunting - cabin. When I arrived, there was the sound of your slumbers. Hearing, I would [fain have] entered. Being [fain], but not going in, - being guilty because I had done ill, - and standing outside during the night, [I heard a sound of] one coming from the forest - [was he] a god, or a devil? Your guardians, the two <pb n="211"/>wolves, and the god of the beginning of the hills, having pity on you, defended you. However, [he] caused [those] gods to go for ever to the underworld. </p>
<p>I therefore, thanks to my carrying that golden knife and that silver knife, with them have killed that devil; I caused him to go for ever to the underworld. [It is] owing to this [that] we are all alive now". [This] told I to my two brothers; having listened, they were astonished: "Then if [it is] owing to our little boy [that] we live now, - then who ? no one - shall take [these] precious things, [these] swords; thyself shalt, although they are, take [them]". Although thou thyself hast broken them, we do not grudge [thee them]". So they said. </p>
<p>After that, the next day they rose up. When they rose up, they made 'inaus' for the guardians, the two wolves [and] the god of the beginning of the hills. They made new gods [of them]. After, again, new guardians looked upon them from <pb n="212"/>above. Afterwards, whatever they did, they were prosperous, they hunted with success. All animals that they slew they slew easily. Many skins had they; [bladders of] gall they had also. When they sold [these], they acquired many precious things for the price [thereof]. Much of all things whatsoever had they, more than the [people of the] ancient houses of Rurupa. They were wealthy men, more so than any other wealthy man.</p>
