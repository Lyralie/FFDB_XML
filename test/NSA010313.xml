<p>A long time ago old Améra lived in Wáiawan [on the south coast of Isla Navarino]. This man<note>The male guanaco, Lama huanachus (Gusinde 1937:34).</note> was a widower and for that reason lived with his two daughters. Both were very pretty, especially the elder. He <pb n="129"/>fell passionately in love with his elder daughter at first without her noticing it. Every day she would go to the forest and bring back large quantities of celery roots, for the old man liked them very much. He would accept them gladly and ate a lot of them, saying: "I like celery roots very much!" The next day the girl would again go into the forest and bring back lots of celery roots to put before her father. </p>
<p>As the days went by he fell deeper in love with his daughter, until he was so excited that whenever he saw her he could hardly eat, for she was extremely beautiful and in the hut wore no clothes at all. Therefore the old man could see how very beautiful she was. Eventually the elder daughter realized that her father had fallen in love with her. It finally reached the point where the old man was so much in love that he could not eat anything at all; he gradually grew pale and lost weight. </p>
<p>The younger daughter noticed it and said to her father: "My father, why do you no longer eat the celery roots that you've always liked so much?" The father replied: "I can't eat because my teeth hurt!" Then this daughter said: "That's possible. Nevertheless, you have to eat something. Every day I see you grow paler and lose more weight. Come on, at least eat something!" The father replied: "I don't feel like eating." So saying, he pulled the fur cover over his face; he was stretched out on his bed in the hut. Now the younger daughter approached him and said: "See these big piles of celery roots that you've always liked so much. At least try to eat something!" To this the old man said: "No, I really can't eat any more! I'm near death and I feel my strength leaving me." He paused a long while and then continued in a sad tone: "I'm very near death. I think it would be best if you buried me now, for I won't live much longer. Bury me very close to our hut, but in such a way that my feet and head remain in the open for the time being until I'm really dead. Also put a yáiyi with ákel<note>The well-known short piece of gut that serves as a little bag in which the red soil used for painting is kept; cf. Gusinde 1937:430, fig. 20.</note> beside me: I want to remain that way until my kéšpix leaves me." At these words the two girls became very sad and cried loudly. The father calmed them down, saying: "Before you bury me there's still something I have to tell you so that you won't be deceived or frightened. Nearby there lives a man who looks exactly like me. One can't tell us apart. That is old Yéxapowa. He looks just like me and I know he's very much in love with the two of you. So when you see this man coming, don't be afraid and don't think it's me. If he wants to caress you, yield to him! I wanted to tell you this to comfort you. Now you can bury me here." </p>
<p>The two girls listened attentively to everything their father told them; they were very sad. Then they buried him the way he had said, so that <pb n="130"/>his head and feet were still uncovered; by his side they put a yáiyi with ákel. When they had finished they again cried loudly and started walking toward another camp. They walked very slowly; they were sad because they had had to say goodbye to their father. </p>
<p>The path to the other camp where their relatives lived went through the forest. When the two girls were far away the old man quickly got up, for in reality he was not near death at all but had only pretended in order to deceive his two daughters. From the yáiyi he took out some ákel and with it painted his entire body. Then he, too, hurried into the forest, but he took a detour and went in a roundabout way. Since he was running very fast he got far ahead of the girls and reached the path that led to the other camp. There the two girls had to pass by, so he waited for them. He said to himself: "Since I've painted myself with a lot of red earth they won't recognize me." After some time the two girls approached; he heard them crying loudly. He got up and went to meet them, calling to them in a changed voice: "What are these two girls doing here all alone and so near our camp?" He went closer to them and said: "Yes, now I recognize you! Tell me, aren't you bringing any news from my good friend, your father? How is he? We haven't seen each other for a long time." The two girls replied: "Oh, by now our father must already have died." So saying they cried again very loudly. "But how did that happen?" asked the old man. The girls replied: "He had a toothache and could no longer eat. He grew paler and paler, and lost weight. Finally he said: 'You can bury me now.' So we buried him as he asked." The old man said: "Oh, what a pity that my old friend has died." As he was saying this the younger sister told the elder: "That must be our father; I recognize his voice!" The elder sister replied: "But sister, that's impossible! Have you forgotten what our father told us before we buried him, so that we wouldn't become frightened or deceived? He said: 'Near here there lives a man who resembles me exactly, so that one can't tell us apart; that is old Yéxapowa. He looks just like me and I know he's in love with both of you. So when you see this man coming, don't be frightened and don't believe that it's me. If he wants to caress you, yield to him. I wanted to tell you this for your comfort.' That's what our father told us. Don't you remember that any more?" The younger sister said: "Yes, I remember all that, but I still think this man here must be our father!" </p>
<p>Although the girls were talking low the old man heard everything. Then he asked them: "Where do you want to go now?" The elder sister answered: "We want to go to the other camp where our relatives live." "Come on," said the man, "don't be so sad! Come with me, I'll show you the way." As he spoke he drew closer and closer to the older girl; <pb n="131"/>then he tenderly took her into his arms and led her behind the thick bushes, where they lay down on the soft moss and yielded to their desire. After some time Améra stood up and went to the place where the younger daughter was sitting. He embraced her, too, and withdrew behind the thicket with her, where both yielded to their lecherous desire. It was some time before they rose again and went to where the older girl was still lying. Then all three burst out laughing and continued what they had been doing. Since then they have remained in the forest with one another, and have never parted!<note>This story is almost identical with two Selknam stories (Gusinde 1931:650; 651; Wilbert 1975:107, 109); one must conclude that the subject matter is one and the same. Here, too, it is above all the love play of the male leader of the herd with the younger, female animals that is represented. The Yamana have no more stories devoted to the guanaco, for in their economy this animal does not have even remotely the importance it has among the Selknam.</note> </p>
<p>Even today the guanacos laugh and giggle in this way. The old father lives with his daughters all the time and has intercourse with them as though they were his wives. Everybody is amused by this. One can also still recognize the small spot of ákel where he had painted himself on that occasion. The daughters likewise have a little of this color, for when Améra embraced them some of it rubbed off. </p>
