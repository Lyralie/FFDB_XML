<p>A woman was one day filling, her ostrich eggs at a spring, which was covered up with some grass. We Bushmen used to hide the water from our enemies in this way. We hide it by stones, or sticking grass or bushes into it. Now a lion saw this woman a long distance off, and he wanted to eat her. The woman had filled some of her eggs, and as she filled them she put them in a net. She heard some very soft footsteps behind her. Thinking it was some of her friends from the village, she called out, "You must wait for the water to come." Now it was a lion, but the woman did not look behind her to see. When the lion heard her talking he stopped. When she had finished speaking, he said to her, with a terrible roar, "You must leave my water to me." The woman was much surprised, and she rose from her knees to run away. Just at that moment the lion sprang at her. He sprang too high up in the air, and he alighted on the other side. The woman then turned and ran to the bushes, and the lion began to smash the ostrich eggs, which were full of water, crying out, "You must leave my water to me." That is why a Bush woman will not go to a spring alone, and when they go you can hear them singing - </p>
