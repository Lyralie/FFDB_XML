<p>"Mother, I want to marry." - "Who is it?" - "Oh, Diorite-Woman." - "Well, then, try again. Will you not be tired if she does not talk?" - "That is what I like." Then he went to his future wife. Night came, and they lay down. He tried to speak to his wife. "Speak!" said Born-to-be-the-Sun to his wife. "You're a funny fellow," she said. "Speak, else I will hit your face." Then he struck his wife's face. "Serves you right. Now your face is all bloody." But it was blood of the hand of Born-to-be-the-Sun. It could not be blood on the face of Diorite-Woman, because she was a stone. And he left. "Mother, I left my wife. I did something to her because she didn't speak." - "Did I not tell you?" said Mother. </p>
