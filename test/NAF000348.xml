<p>The jackal and the python were walking together. The jackal said "Give me your shoes." And the python said "No, the sand is very hot. I won't give you my shoes." But the jackal took them anyway and put them on. They kept on walking, and the jackal said "How would it be if we walked a little bit further and I gave the shoes back to you on up ahead?" So they walked on, and presently the jackal just ran off with the shoes. Ran off with them and kept them. Never gave them back to the python at all. The jackal just ran off with them and kept them. Then the jackal changed into a jackal (before, the jackal had been a person). And the other person was changed into a python.</p>
