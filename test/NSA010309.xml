<p>A long time ago a powerful dolphin<note>The big dolphin, Globicephala melas.</note> came here from the open sea. It swam very close to the surface of the water and the people could see it easily. It stopped when it got close to a large camp where many people had built their huts. All loudly gave vent to their joy; they wanted to kill it on the spot and let it beach itself. It was extremely large and promised much blubber and oil. Instantly all the men grabbed their harpoons and the women pushed the canoes into the water; the individual families got in and quickly paddled toward the dolphin. From all sides the men threw their harpoons against the animal's large body. They put up a great effort, but then they grew tired and ran out of harpoons. The dolphin did not seem to notice the multitude of large and deep wounds at all; there was nothing to indicate that it was exhausted and might beach itself. </p>
<p>Disappointed, the people returned to camp. Some of them still had one or two harpoons left in their huts which they brought out. Others sat down and hastily assembled new ones. Anyone who had a few weapons at hand got back into his canoe and went out toward the dolphin, again throwing his harpoon against it. Once again many men spent all their weapons, but totally without success. The powerful animal continued to swim about and to ignore the wounds; there was nothing to suggest that it was tired and might beach itself. The men had exhausted themselves. </p>
<p>The people found it strange that the dolphin kept opening its mouth wide and then leisurely closing it again. One of the men had a cunning thought and hastened to say: "This powerful wéoina keeps opening its big mouth wide and then very slowly closes it again. What if an agile man jumped into its mouth, proceeded quickly into its stomach, and cut it up completely from inside?" It was little Lášix<note>The black martin, Iridoprocne [Tachycineta] Meyeni.</note> to whom this idea occurred. Timidly the other men replied: "You yourself may try to jump into its mouth if you have the courage!" He answered bravely: "All right, I'll try." </p>
<p>So all the people returned once more to the beach where their camp was. The men had again deployed all their weapons, and promptly started manufacturing new ones. But Lášix made himself a big, sharp knife. The women improved their canoes and caulked them well, for the vessels had badly suffered from knocking repeatedly against the dolphin and from the many movements of the men hurling their <pb n="114"/>harpoons. After the people had finished their particular tasks they returned to their canoes and paddled toward the animal. </p>
<p>Once again the men threw their heavy harpoons against the huge body of the dolphin, but although the harpoons remained stuck in it they showed no effect. Little Lášix said to his wife: "Steer the canoe exactly in front of its mouth." His wife paddled on, steered her canoe exactly in front of the mouth of the dolphin, and stopped. As usual little Lášix sat up front in the bow. When the dolphin once again slowly opened its big mouth, little Lášix made a vigorous leap and jumped inside. The dolphin swallowed little Lášix without any difficulty. </p>
<p>But now the dolphin slowly left the coast and swam far out to the open sea. Inside the stomach little Lášix began to cut up the animal's inner organs with his big sharp knife. He cut up its lungs, stomach, liver, and bowels, so that the dolphin had to vomit; it opened its big mouth again and again and threw up all these pieces. For the time being, however, little Lášix spared the dolphin's heart, so that the animal would continue to live for some time. Little Lášix realized that the dolphin had to be swimming out on the open sea: through the wall of the dolphin's stomach he could hear high waves beating constantly against it. He hoped that the sick and weak animal would eventually approach shore exhausted; not until then would he cut up the heart. But all he heard was high waves beating and breaking against the powerful body. He began to feel very uneasy and said to himself: "All this is lasting too long for me. I'd better cut up the heart right now and try to get out of here, however I can! How do I even know where I am; certainly still on the open sea." Then little Lášix unexpectedly heard the quacking of the wíyen.<note>The wild duck, Anas cristata, which travels in flocks.</note> To him it was a sign that he was near land, for these wíyen live near the coast. He quickly cut up the big dolphin's heart and at once much blood flowed. The dolphin lost all its strength. It became very sad, feeling that death was near. Soon it was unable to breathe and could neither swim nor move; it only kept itself on the surface by floating, and the waves alone propelled it. Finally all strength left it and it no longer moved; it was now really dead. </p>
<p>Soon the big dášalux<note>The big albatross, Diomedea melanophrys.</note> came in a flock to have themselves a good meal from the huge animal. Little Lášix noticed this from inside, for he heard the big birds hacking on the back of the dead dolphin. At once he made up his mind, saying: "I'll knock hard against the stomach wall. This will frighten the birds; they'll fly up and hover high in the air. The people will observe this from afar and say to themselves: 'It must be a dead dolphin floating around there!' Then they will quickly set out and <pb n="115"/>come here; I'll be able to save myself." So little Lášix knocked hard against the stomach wall of the dead dolphin; all the dášalux became very frightened and flew up. They flew high up in the air and hovered excitedly for a long time. Then they lowered themselves again and perched on the dead animal, which the waves were slowly pushing along. There were so many dášalux hovering over the carcass that they attracted the attention of the people in the camp. They called to one another: "There must be a dead dolphin drifting out there, for many dášalux keep flying up all the time!" Once little Lášix had cut up the heart of the wéoina the dolphin had turned toward the coast again. When it got close to the camp those people there discovered it. </p>
<p>After a while little Lášix once more knocked against the stomach wall of the dead dolphin. Again the flock of dášalux became frightened; they flew away and rose up high. For a long time they hovered in the air and then returned to perch on the back of the dead animal, which the waves were slowly propelling. Little Lášix told himself: "I hope my people have been observing the many dášalux! Then they'll soon come with their canoes and I'll be saved!" And, indeed, he was soon overjoyed to hear the beating of the paddles, for that meant that many canoes had come up close to the big dolphin. He heard the lamentations and cries of his people. They were mourning for brave little Lášix whom they considered lost and dead by then. The many people that had gathered around the big, dead dolphin pooled their strength and pulled it closer to the coast, where the current would assist in pushing it ashore. Everybody exerted himself and pulled vigorously. When at last the huge animal lay on the beach they said to one another in low voices and full of satisfaction: "It's really an unusually big and fat dolphin!" It was already late in the evening, so they hurried back to their huts. All were very happy; now there was blubber and meat in abundance. </p>
<p>In this place the people were just enacting kína and a large number of men were participating. When so mighty a dolphin was given them completely unexpectedly they were beside themselves with joy, for now they had lots of blubber and meat available and were able to extend their kína for a long time. At dawn the next day they promptly cut up and distributed much fat and meat from the dolphin; each got a big piece. They ate large amounts and were very contented. Several days passed. One night two boys from the kína-hut, who were to be initiated, were sent to the beach where the dolphin was lying. They were to cut out a few pieces of meat and bring them to the kína-hut, where the men wanted more to eat. The two boys ran to where the animal was lying. They brought a long knife. With this, one of them made a deep cut into the dolphin, so deep that he hit a rib; he wanted <pb n="116"/>to cut out a big piece. Then he suddenly heard from inside: "Hi, hi, hi"; it sounded as though a man had been wounded. He also heard: "Don't stab me!" The boy became very frightened and said to himself: "What can that be? It sounds exactly as if a man were sitting in there calling to me: 'Don't stab me!' Who might that be?" Fear seized him but he did not want to show it. Instead he called the other boy, and told him with decided satisfaction: "Look what a nice piece of meat I cut out of this part of the body! You cut with the knife, but very deep!" That was all he said. Then the other boy took the long knife and cut deeply into the dolphin. Now he, too, heard the cry from inside: "Hi, hi, hi, don't cut me!" That frightened him very much. Only then did the other boy admit: "I also heard this voice before! What can that be?" He replied: "How strange all this is! What can it be?" The two boys knew nothing of what had occurred, namely, that all the people had been harpooning the dolphin unsuccessfully for a long time and that finally little Lášix had jumped into its mouth. As boys about to be initiated in the kína they had not been allowed to leave the Big Hut at the time when all the others had been struggling over the dolphin. </p>
<p>The two boys went back to the kína-hut, each carrying a big piece of meat. They put the pieces down before the one in charge of the ceremony and hurried silently to their places. All the men inspected the pieces of meat approvingly. The one in charge instructed the two boys: "Roast these pieces of meat and distribute them among the men!" The two novices sat down by the fire, roasted the big pieces of meat, cut them up, and gave some to each man. Only then did they reveal what they had heard when they sliced off the pieces of meat. That also surprised the men. After all, they had just spent all their weapons on that dolphin, seemingly in vain, and they remembered that little Lášix had earlier intended to kill him. He had since disappeared, however, and the dolphin had left the coast. They finally agreed, assuming correctly, "The animal out there on the beach must be the dolphin we harpooned; it was certainly this one into whose mouth little Lášix jumped. So he's still alive!" </p>
<p>It was barely getting light in the east when all the men from the kína-hut rushed straight down to the beach where the big dolphin was lying. They did this very early in the morning so that the women and children would not be able to see from the camp what was happening. Each of the men cautiously sliced into the meat with his knife along the entire length of the big animal and together they lifted off the whole layer of meat that covered the ribs. Then with even greater care they lifted off all the meat lying between the ribs and close to the inside of the rib cage. Thus they reached the belly. This too they now opened with their knives, but taking special care. And here sat little Lášix, all huddled up, <pb n="117"/>pale and thin, bald, and near death! Pity swept through the crowd when they saw him in this miserable condition. They immediately took him from the belly of the big dolphin and carried him quickly to the kína-hut. None of the women and children could witness any of this from the camp; the men had carried everything out very unobtrusively. Here in the kína-hut the men placed little Lášix by the fire where he could warm himself. They gave him much to eat so that he might grow strong and regain his speech. They also rubbed oil all over his body to revive him. On his bald head they sprinkled pulverized charcoal to make the lost hair grow back. Thus they attended to him and cared for him in the best possible way. Under the care given him by all the men in the kína-hut little Lášix soon felt better and quickly recovered. Also his hair was growing again. With each day he felt better and better. </p>
<p>Lášix spent a long time in the kína-hut with the other men; neither women nor children in the camp knew any of this. Little Lášix had three wives in all. Since he had been gone for such a long time and since he was believed dead, two of the three women soon looked for another husband. But the third wife was determined to continue waiting just in case her husband might still come back. She remained faithful to him. She already had several children by him. </p>
<p>According to custom, the men left the kína-hut at certain intervals and went out into the open. Women and children were then allowed to leave the camp, approach the group of men, and look at them. One day the men were playing kálaka and the women drew near so they could watch each player closely. One of them soon attracted attention; he was extremely skillful and thrilled all the spectators. Among the latter there was also the woman who had remained faithful to little Lášix. When she saw this man's extraordinary cleverness she watched attentively for some time. Then she said, barely audibly: "That player there looks very much like my husband, who was extremely good at kálaka. But of course, it is utterly impossible that he be my husband, for everybody assumes him to be dead by now!" The men finished their game of kálaka and went back to the kína-hut; the women and children returned to the camp. </p>
<p>Little Lášix was now almost completely restored. He realized that his father believed him long dead and was profoundly mourning his death. On several occasions he had already sent for his father to come to the kína-hut, but in vain. The old man was feeling the most bitter grief; each day he painted himself anew and wept all day long. For this very reason he did not want to leave his hut and show himself to other people. Once again the men in the kína-hut urgently sent for the old man. At last he came. The men put his son, little Lášix, before him; the latter was still pale and thin and noticeably bald. When little Lášix saw <pb n="118"/>his old father deeply bent from grief he could no longer control himself and out of pity for him burst into loud sobs. He cried so loudly and so hard that the people in the camp could hear him. His wife who had remained faithful to him paid particular attention, saying: "That crying sounds exactly as though it came from my husband! I wonder if it's really him crying so loudly? But how could it be - he's been dead for so long! Did he not jump into the mouth of that wéoina which then swam out to the open sea and hasn't shown up since. What a pity it is about my dear husband!" </p>
<p>The men took great delight in the kína-celebration, and did not think of ending it soon. One day they went out again, intending to hunt seals. For some time they had already been in possession of extremely well-made harpoon points so that their hunt was always successful. By chance the woman who had remained faithful to little Lášix saw one of these harpoon points in the hands of one of the men. Unobtrusively she examined it closely and said to herself: "How could this man have gotten this extremely well-made harpoon point? The men spent all their harpoon points some time ago when struggling with the big dolphin that passed by here. Since then I have not noticed even a single man making new harpoon points. Besides, not one of these men is capable of fashioning such perfect harpoon points as my husband used to. He was really incomparably more skilled in this work than anybody else; nobody could match him. How much I miss my dear husband: how much I've already wept over him!" And again she cried bitterly. </p>
<p>After a long, long time the men decided at last to end their kína-celebration. Meanwhile all of little Lášix's hair had grown back and he was now fully recovered. Together, as usual, all the men left the big kína-hut and returned to the camp. Here brave little Lášix now showed himself to his faithful wife, his relatives, and all the other people. Everyone was speechless with joy and surprise. Little Lášix proceeded to relate in detail all he had gone through and how he had saved himself. The people marveled at this brave little man; they were very happy and thanked him for giving them this enormous wéoina. Happiest of all was his faithful wife; she had had to wait for him for so long. </p>
