<head>NEE028170</head>
<p>I was a woman. At one end of my village [there lived] six young men; at the other end of my village [there lived] six young men. When from one end of the village the six young men went to catch seals, I every year ate [much], living well. When from the other end of the village the six young men went likewise to catch seals, I ate [much], living well. Being grateful for this, I made one day six garments of bark for the [six] young men of one end of the village. </p>
<p>Being grateful for my daily food, one day I sewed six garments of bark. For the six young men of the other end of the village, I likewise sewed six garments of bark in one day. Being grateful, one year, with six robes of seal-skin did they clothe me. The six young men from the other end of the village likewise one year clad me with six robes of seal-skin. Being grateful, with various foods dug out of the earth did I in my turn give thanks. </p>
<p>Doing [so], one day, having heard the birds' [talk, I knew <pb n="233"/>that] the young men from one end of the village [and] the young men from the other end of the village had gone to the forest to strip off bark. Two days did I wait for them, but could not [see them again]. Therefore, one day I went to the forest. Then went I on the hunting-track of the six young men from one end of the village. </p>
<p>[Thus] doing, I arrived at a tarn. At one extremity of the tarn the lifeless corpses of the six young men of one end of my village lay stretched out. At the other extremity of the tarn, the lifeless corpses of the six young men of the other end of my village lay, [and] I saw [them]. On the shore of the tarn I lay down [and] wept; whilst I did [so], the day's end came: I rose. Then, in the centre of the tarn a huge trout waved its tail, and at the end of the tarn it opened its mouth silently: I saw [this]. </p>
<p>Then [I saw] a wide path going towards the forest; and along it I went, drooping. Before me, on the way [there was] a large house, to [which] I came. I sought where the door was; I struck with my hands on two sliding panels of iron; <pb n="234"/>they creaked, I pushed them back, and entered. I sat down close to the door. By the right wall [there] sat a big wealthy man; he rose at once, took down a black tray from a shelf, [and] having placed some bear's flesh on the tray, handed it to me, stooping very low. </p>
<p>I took it, raising it up. Two tiny bits did I take; being ashamed, I ate but one tiny bit. I raised [the tray], giving [it back to him]; he took it, stooping low. On the shelf he [re-]placed it, [as] I saw. Afterwards he put me questions [to which I answered]: "Now, when the young men who gave me to eat went to strip off bark, and when I waited, I could [wait] no [longer]. </p>
<p>Therefore to-day I went on the hunting-track of the six young men, and arrived at a [certain] tarn; after that, in the centre of the tarn I saw a huge trout. At one extremity of the tarn the lifeless corpses of the six young men of one end of my village; at the other extremity of the tarn, the lifeless corpses of the six young men of the other end of my village: having seen, I tell thee that". </p>
<p>This rich man, growling, took down a black fur from a shelf, [and] put [it] on over his head. I had it in my mind to fear. Then he took a sword down, and whetted [it] on a whetstone [from, which] some liquid dripped. Then he thrust <pb n="235"/>it into his girdle, and went with me: - "I am going with thee to my tarn". - So I went gladly with him; to his tarn he came with me. Being at the one end of the lake, he cut with his sword at that huge trout, and the sword broke. </p>
<p>Afterwards with a growl, he went to the forest. Having made a hook of maple-wood, he brought it. With the hook of maple-wood did he catch hold of that huge trout [which] at the end of the tarn had silently opened its mouth. This man dragged it to the end of the tarn. At the end of the tarn [the two] beings fought; at the other end of the tarn [the two] beings fought. When I saw this big man thrown down a lifeless corpse at one end of the tarn, I fell down weeping; [thus] doing. </p>
<p>Afterwards I rose and went away; to my house did I come. In my poor house, in the midst [of it], the dust was <pb n="236"/>standing high; long had it [lain there]! As once I had done, I put things in order carefully, and I lived all alone. One day, as I was living [thus] I heard the birds [say] that a wealthy man, coming from afar, was coming to me. </p>
<p>Having spent two days, I heard upon the sea the creaking [of oars] of a small boat. On my poor way I heard the sound of the footsteps of a man approaching. [He] came in. When I saw the man who entered, clad in black silk, sat down close to me, I thought thus: "How well it is! I shall make [him] feed me!" so thought I. That night were we married. </p>
<p>Afterwards we lived as I had lived formerly. After two years we married for good. [We, being] very powerful [in magic], had no children, and both grew old. Afterwards, having no man [of our] kindred, we died. [So] lay we, two bodies [without burial]. In the Underworld our trace has vanished quite. Where we went, no men are [to be found], the true gods have destroyed us.</p>
