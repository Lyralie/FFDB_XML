<p>A young girl was walking back to her house from the river. She met Chan Med- katò<note>Chan Med- katò literally means, "foot eye-day" i.e. the sun's foot. No one could explain to me the reason for this name, or why the legend is usually identified by this person's name although he is not the main character. I suspect that a confusion has arisen, and that the person so called is in fact the man who ends up marrying the girl. (see Note 3 below).</note> on the way. He wanted to marry her, but she would not agree. On their way they passed a large stone. Inside it was a wasp<note>The Chewong name is tobul. Since it stings, but does not produce honey, I have chosen to call it a wasp. I can think of no reason why it is located inside a stone; this image did not occur elsewhere, and the storyteller was unable to explain its special significance, beyond the fact that it demonstrated the superior abilities of the ugly man.</note>. "If you can get that wasp inside this stone, I will marry you," said the girl to Chan Med-katò. "Oh that is easy," replied he, "just wait a little." He went back to the settlement and told the other young men, "If we can get out the wasp that is inside the stone, the girl will marry us." When they heard this all the young men took their axes and spears and went to the stone. But try as hard as they could, they did not succeed in splitting open the stone. So in the evening they returned to the settlement. "Have you done it?" asked the girl. "No, not yet. We'll manage it tomorrow," they said. When the girl heard this she would have nothing to do with them and she went to her own house. The following morning the men sharpened their axe heads and spears and then they went to the stone. But again they could not crack it open, so they went home and cooked some vegetables. They did not have any meat to eat as they were lazy and did not go hunting. </p>
<p>Two or three months went by. The men wanted the girl, but she would have nothing to do with them. One day she went to the river to bathe. They followed after her. They wanted to grab her and force her to sleep with them, but they could not find her anywhere. Another day when she went into the field to dig some sweet potatoes they went after her again. But again they could not find her. </p>
<p>One day a man from the headwaters of the river<note>It will be remembered that "hidden people" (bi inhar) live at the headwaters of the rivers. They are by definition great <ref target="g:GEE2143.032">putao</ref>. It is possible that the confusion referred to above concerns the place from which this character came. Bi inhar also live at the places where the sun sets and rises, called "the feet of the sun" (chan med-katò) and he could have come from one of these.</note> arrived at the settlement. He was very dirty with an ugly body. He was covered in sores. When the people saw him, they shouted "dirty, dirty!" and did not invite him to enter their houses. Word quickly spread around that an unclean person had arrived. All the young girls spat after him. When he passed the house where the beautiful girl lived, the old people inside [her parents] looked at him. "Oh it is you, grand child. Come inside," they said to him. "No, no, I am unclean," replied he. The old woman looked closely at him. "Come inside and have something to eat," she insisted. So he entered their house and was given food. "Oh, the ugly man has entered the house of the beautiful girl and he has been given food there," said Chan Med-katò <pb n="26"/>when he saw it. "We are never asked in there," complained another of the young men. </p>
<p>When the ugly man had finished eating he got up. "Where are you going?" asked the girl. "I want to go to the river to bathe," said he. On his way to the river the girls spat at him and threw stones after him. When he reached the river he took an attap leaf and hit the water with it. All the water disappeared and lots of fish were left on the riverbed. He took as many as he could carry and placed them on the bank. Then the river filled up again. The man returned to the girl's house and told the old people there that there were one or two fish by the river which he had caught. The old mother went with her daughter to collect them. There were so many fish that both their backbaskets were filled. </p>
<p>The man slept on the platform where the fireplace was. He did not want to sleep inside the main part of the house where everyone else were sleeping. "I am unclean," he said. "I will sleep out here." </p>
<p>When the fish had finished, the ugly man asked the old man whether he had a walking stick. "I do," said he, "it was going to be a blow pipe, but I never finished it." "That does not matter," said the man, "I do not want to go hunting, just to walk around a bit." He took the stick and went with the dog that was lying outside into the jungle. He made a fire and took some earth from an ant hill and this he threw into the fire whereupon it turned into a species of wild tuber (taggad). Then all kinds of leafmonkeys appeared, siamang and gibbon, and he lifted up the walking stick and shot them with it. He picked up all the meat and carried it to the outskirts of the settlement, where he left it and returned to the house. "There is a squirrel child which I have caught," he told them, "if you want it you can collect it on the path." the people went to collect it and they found so much meat that their backbaskets were filled and they had to make an improvised carrying frame of leaves and sticks. </p>
<p>The man wanted to bathe. When the girls saw him they told him that he could not bathe in their river. He was too disgusting, he would have to go to another river. He did as he was told. </p>
<p>When all the meat had been eaten, he said that he would go fishing. The beautiful girl decided to follow him unobserved. When he reached the river, she hid behind a tree watching him. He took off his ugly "cloak" and went into the river where he caught lots of fish. The girl looked at him. He was very handsome. Then she went home. When the man had finished fishing, he put on his ugly cloak again and went back and told the people, "there are one or two fish by the river if you want them!" They went to see and found lots and lots of fish. </p>
<p>The next day the beautiful girl said that she was going to marry the man. Everyone flocked to see the wedding of her to the ugly man. The man had gone back to his own settlement to collect his parents and brothers and sisters and they were late in arriving. All the people who were waiting to see the marriage began to ask "where is the ugly man?" At last the man entered the house. He had thrown away his ugly cloak and he was clean and handsome. When they saw him all <pb n="27"/>the girls who had spat at him and been nasty tb him become very ashamed and quickly went home, pretending that they had forgotten to do something there, or that they were not feeling well. </p>
<p>A few days later the new husband said that he had heard that there was a wasp inside a stone. "There is," said his wife, "but it is impossible to cut the stone open." "Show me where it is," said the man, "I want to have a look at it." When Chan Med-katò heard that the beautiful girl's husband wanted to see the stone, he wanted to go as well to have a look. All the young men who had tried to open the stone also went. When they reached the stone the husband cut off a long leaf, rolled it up and tapped at the stone with it.<note>There is probably a connection between these uses of a rolled up leaf (see also above) and the shaman's whisk, also a rolled leaf (of a different species) with which the <ref target="g:GEE2143.032">putao</ref> slaps his hand during <ref target="g:GEE2143.025">nöpoh</ref> and other healing activities.</note> The stone immediately broke into two parts and he took out the wasp. When the young men saw this they left and returned to their own land. </p>
