<p>Kauha and ǀ"xashe dzunini were living together. Kauha had no fire, but ǀ"xashe dzunini did have fire ǀ"xashe ate cooked food, and Kauha ate raw food. One day ǀ"xashe gave some cooked food to his children. The children were eating it and playing "War," and Kauha came and watched them at their playing-place. "Give me a taste of what you're eating," he said. The children gave him a piece, and he exclaimed, "Koo! what is this delicious cooked food these children are eating? Why am I eating raw food all the time when other people are eating cooked food?" But since he had no fire he just kept on eating raw things, and ǀ"xashe dzunini and his children kept on eating cooked things.</p>
<p>One day Kauha asked himself "I wonder what this guy ǀ"xashe is doing to his food so that it is cooked so nicely? Why don't I go watch what he does, and then I can do it too?" So the next morning when ǀ"xashe dzunini and his people were going out gathering, Kauha said that he would stay home. But when the others had set out upon their path together, Kauha followed them secretly. He saw them digging ǁxaru bulbs. He watched them for a long time. Then they began to come one by one into a shady place to eat their ǁxaru. Kauha climbed a tree to watch them. "Today I'm going to find out what these people do to their food." He sat in the tree and watched. One by one the people came into the shade. When they were all there, ǀ"xashe dzunini went to a tree and took sticks of wood out of the heart of it. Then he sat down. "Dzunini! Dzunini!" went the firesticks, and the fire started! "Why don't all of us have fire and eat cooked food like this guy?" thought Kauha. "ǀ"xashe dzunini is certainly living well. Why am I living in the midst of fire and still eating raw food?" Meanwhile, ǀ"xashe dzunini was putting wood on his fire, and it burned up brightly. "Koo!" thought Kauha. "Is this what this guy does? Has he had this thing all along and I never knew it?" He watched them as they roasted their ǁxaru. They cooked it and peeled it, and then they ate it. When it was all gone, they started home to the camp.</p>
<p>Kauha came down from his tree and sneaked back before they got there. When ǀ"xashe and his people arrived, he said "let's make a jani toy and throw it up in the air." The others agreed to play, and they tied a hornbill's feather to the jani toy. But the jani wouldn't fly with a hornbill's feather, so next they tried a nəm's feather. But the nəm's feather didn't work either. They tried a guinea fowl's feather, but still the jani wouldn't fly. Then they tried all the feathers they could think of. Nothing worked.</p>
<p>At last Kauha said "Say! Let's tie on a kori bustard's feather!" The others agreed. With the kori bustard's feather the jani flew beautifully. Kauha threw it up in the air and it fled from the people and headed toward the east. Kauha ran after it. The jani didn't come down to the ground: it kept on flying up and down and up and down. "Come on, everybody! Let's chase this jani; where in the world is it going?"</p>
<p>ǀ"xashe dzunini and Kauha and all the children ran after the jani. It flew far away. Finally it came to circle around a big tree that had a lot of dead branches. Kauha ran to the tree and gathered an armload of branches. He began to fling the wood in every direction, shouting "Why shouldn't there be fire in all the land so that everyone will have it? What has this ǀ"xashe been doing, keeping it all to himself?" Them ǀ"xashe felt ashamed. Since then, wood for making fire has been plentiful everywhere, and everybody has fire.</p>
