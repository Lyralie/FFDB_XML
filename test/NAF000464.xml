<p>The men of the old time told this story: The moon wanted to send a message to the men of the early race, to tell them that as she died and came to life again, so they would die, and dying come to life again. So the moon called the tortoise; the moon said to the tortoise: "You go over to those men there, and give them this message from me. Tell them that as I dying live again, so they dying will live again." Now the tortoise was very slow, and he kept repeating the message to himself, so as not to forget it. But he forgot it, and so he turned back to ask the moon to repeat it to him. The moon was very vexed with his slowness, and with his forgetting, so she called the hare, and said to the hare, "You are a swift runner. Take this message to the men over yonder: 'As I dying live again, so you will dying live again.'" So off the hare started, but in her great haste she forgot the message, and as she did not wish to show the moon that she had forgot, she delivered the message to the men in this way: "As I dying live again, so you dying will die for ever." This was the message. In the meantime the tortoise had remembered the message, and he started off a second time. "This time," said he to himself, "I won't forget." He got to the place where the men were, and he delivered his message. When the men heard his message, they were very angry with the hare, who was sitting at some distance. She was nibbling the grass after her race. One of them ran and lifted a stone, and threw it at the hare. It struck her right in the mouth, and cleft her upper lip, so that it has remained so ever since. This is why every hare has a cleft upper lip, and it is the end of the tale.</p>
