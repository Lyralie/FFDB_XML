<p>A lion and a jackal went to hunt one day. They came in sight of a lot of elands, and the lion shot with his bow and missed his buck. Then the jackal tried and hit his eland. The lion was angry and called out, "I have hit, you haves missed." Now the jackal was afraid, and agreed with the lion and said, "Yes, you have hit." After that they went home to have a sleep, intending to come back, to cut up the meat. As soon as the lion was asleep, the jackal went back to the dead buck, and tearing out its belly crawled into it, and began to eat all the best part of the fat round the heart. </p>
<p>The lion awoke and immediately came to the carcase, and saw the jackal's tail sticking out of the dead eland. So the lion caught him by the tail, and swung him out, and ordered him to stand at a distance. Afterwards the lion gave the jackal some small pieces of meat to eat, and told him to take some of the best of the fat to the lion's wife and children, but the jackal took the fat to his own wife and children, and then he fled quite away with his own wife and children to another part of the country. The tale is ended. </p>
