<p>Then Ōʼᵋmāł said that he would gamble with Gull. He gambled with Gull, and Ōʼᵋmāł staked his bear-skin blanket, and Gull also staked his blanket against Ōʼᵋmāł. Then he gambled with Gull, and Ōʼᵋmāł lost to Gull. "Hungry, hungry, hungry!" said Ōʼᵋmāł to Gull. "Hë!" Gull. "I am hungry." Thus said Gull. "Oh, you said are hungry!" said Ōʼᵋmāł. "Yes, I am hungry." - "Let me point at the pit of your stomach," [said Ōʼᵋmāł]. Then he pointed at the pit of Gull's stomach. Ōʼᵋmāł arose and pointed at the pit of the stomach of Gull. Then Gull screamed, and vomited the food in his belly. Herring was the food in his belly. Then Ōʼᵋmāł took the food that had been in the belly of Gull and started for his canoe, and rubbed it inside with the herring. Then he also rubbed the outside, and his hat and his <pb n="237"/>bailer. He rubbed everything in the canoe. Then he paddled, and arrived at the house of Wealthy. He went up from the beach, and sat down on the floor of the house of Wealthy. "Hë!" said Ōʼᵋmāł, "I am tired of my work." Thus said Ōʼᵋmāł. "What have you been working?" said Wealthy to Ōʼᵋmāł. "These great many herrings that came up," said Ōʼᵋmāł. "Ha, ha!" said Wealthy, and laughed. "Where should they come from?" Thus said Wealthy to Ōʼᵋmāł. "Go and look at my canoe," said Ōʼᵋmāł. Then Mouse went and came back. "It is true," said Mouse. "Then let us pull down the [room] faced with boards." Thus said Wealthy to Mouse. Then the [room] faced with boards were pulled down, and great masses of herrings rushed out. Then Ōʼᵋmāł was down on his stomach among the herrings. He went out of the house of Wealthy. </p>
