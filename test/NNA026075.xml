<p>A boy and his mother lived together. No other people lived near by. The boy grew to be a young man and a very energetic hunter. After a time he ceased to care for hunting, and all his energy seemed to have left him. He became very lazy, and would not hunt. This distressed his mother, for they depended much on game for food. At last she asked him why he had become so lazy. He answered <pb n="239"/>that he did not know, and that he just felt that way. His mother said, "I know the reason. Now you must do with me what your father did and you will be strong." Then he copulated with his mother; and soon he became energetic, as before. He hunted hard at first; but, pouring himself out too much, he became listless and lazy, as before. </p>
<p>This is why people say that a lad at puberty, or when young, is at first very energetic. Later he becomes very lazy. Then, if he marries without beginning to sleep with women, he loses his lazyness, and becomes energetic again. If he pours himself out a little, it is good; but if he battens, as most young men do, he becomes lazy again, and inactive. Only later in life, or when really adult, does his true disposition appear. Then he becomes continuously energetic, lazy, or indifferent.</p>
