<p>Long ago a dead whale once drifted ashore on the coast. The nearest inhabitants lit four big fires to inform the other people. The others saw the fires and said: "A whale has stranded; quickly, let us go there!" They took their canoes and went to where the whale was. Within a short time many people came together. Héšpul,<note>This little sparrow, of the family Tyrannidae, is Taeniptera pyrope.</note> too, came with his people; he led his group and brought them to the place where the whale was lying. Although many people had already arrived Héšpul was not recognized by anyone when he and his group got there. Despite the fact that he was the headman of his group, the people entertained the newcomers well and treated them in a much friendlier manner than they did Héšpul himself. Nobody knew him. </p>
<p>This indifferent behavior toward him by the other people hurt Héšpul very much. He felt gravely offended because they did not respect and wait on him as a powerful yékamuš should be. He did not say anything, but soon began considering how he might take revenge on those who were paying him so little attention. One beautiful, clear day, just when the sun was at its highest point, he let it become completely dark. The people were very frightened and wondered in amazement: <pb n="167"/>"What is this? What can it mean? Where's this darkness coming from all of a sudden?" At the same time they were seized by great fear. Then Héšpul declared: "It is I who sent you this darkness because you are not treating me with the respect that properly befits a yékamuš! I am Héšpul, the great yékamuš!" The people looked at one another, rather embarrassed. Then they asked him: "How long is this darkness going to last?" He answered harshly: "It will last forever!" The people became very sad and began to cry. After some time they begged: "Please take away this darkness! If it stays the way it is now we'll be unable to see and we'll die of hunger. If you do that we'll also wait on you particularly well!" A few went to his hut and said: "Listen, we didn't know you! So don't be offended by our behavior. Now we'll pick out the best pieces of meat and the best blubber for you. Forgive us and take away this darkness. After all, now we know that you're a powerful yékamuš!" Héšpul answered: "All right, I'll forgive you for this mistake, but know now that I'm a powerful yékamuš." </p>
<p>Then the people left his hut. He rubbed white paint all over his body and painted the red line across his face; finally he put the feather headdress on his head and soon began to sing his song of the east. As he was thus singing, it slowly dawned in the east. As he continued chanting it grew lighter and lighter, until finally it was as light as when the sun is at its peak. The people were happy and gave a sigh of relief. They immediately prepared a big feast. They gave Héšpul the tastiest pieces of meat and selected the best blubber for him. All were cheerful and contented. </p>
<p>Thus Héšpul even today still chants his "song of the east," "Pit, pit, pit," every morning. But it grows light very slowly, since the people of that time had not honored him sufficiently. All are happy as soon as it is light again and heave a deep sigh of relief following the dark night. Héšpul, the powerful yékamuš, continues to be highly revered even today. </p>
