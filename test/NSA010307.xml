<p>Old Wekatánaxipa<note>The "wekatána" in the eastern dialect is the same as the "túwux" in the western dialect and denotes the dark-grey night heron, Nycticorax obscurus.</note> was a diligent fisherwoman. On every journey she was lucky and brought back a considerable amount of fish. She always used a téši for fishing. Whenever she went out to sea she took her small grandson along. He sat up front in the bow and kept his face turned forward; she sat at the other end looking in the opposite direction. Thus the two sat with their backs to each other. </p>
<p><pb n="109"/>Old Wekatánaxipa was very stingy. Every time a fish bit she pulled in her tackle, grasping it in such a way that her body completely hid the fish from the little grandson sitting up front. She did not want him to see how big the fish was. She kept the big fish she caught hidden under the boards at the bottom of the canoe; only the few little fish she caught did she throw to her grandson. He did not at all like getting only small fish. Finally, one day he asked: "Tell me, dear grandmother: How is it that you always catch only small fish? You keep throwing me small fish. Why don't you let me have a big fish for once? For I can well see that there are many big fish swimming around our canoe right now; they sometimes even bump against it quite noisily. But you always assure me: 'Only the small fish bite on my tackle, none of the big ones!' How is that?" As always, the grandmother answered: "Well, actually I don't know either why this is so! Nothing but small fish bite on my tackle, not big ones. That's why I can't let you have any big fish." </p>
<p>But the little boy did not believe his grandmother; after all, he kept seeing many big fish swimming around the canoe. From then on he watched his grandmother very closely. Soon he noticed that she caught many more big fish than small ones and that she hurriedly hid them under the boards at the bottom of the canoe, giving him only the few little fish, just as before. He became furious with his stingy grandmother; he did not want to stay with her any longer nor have anything more to do with her. So he said to her: "Grandmother, my stomach hurts; I have to go aside; go in to shore quickly, I'm in a hurry!" She replied: "How come? Hold out a bit longer and wait a little; soon we'll turn around." To this he said anxiously: "I really can't stand it any longer, I'm in a great hurry. Go in to shore quickly, otherwise something bad will happen to me!" So the old woman quickly went toward shore. When the little boy stood up to disembark he angrily threw the small fish into the water and jumped out of the canoe. Downcast he hurried to the hut. He was very annoyed with his grandmother and wanted nothing more to do with her; she had treated him very badly. </p>
<p>The boy's grandfather was sitting in the hut. As soon as he saw his little grandson return alone he asked: "Why are you coming back here all alone, and on foot at that? What happened that made you come back alone? Where is my wife?" His grandson answered plaintively: "She is still out there in the canoe. I didn't want to stay with her any longer and simply ran away. She gave me nothing but small fish to eat, and that I won't put up with any more. I became very angry and ran away." The old man did not answer a word. The little boy asked for some ími [red soil for painting] because he wanted to paint himself. His <pb n="110"/>grandfather let him have his way. He gave him ími and the grandson painted himself. No sooner had he finished doing so than he left the hut without saying a word. He ran deep into the forest and became a bird. He never ever returned to the hut again but has stayed since then in the forest. That is the little tulératéčix, the nimble tree-creeper [Aphrastura spinicauda] which elsewhere is called tečikàšina.<note>This form refers to the round pebble (Gusinde 1937:1213, fig. 93) which the grandmother used; cf. p. 95 n. 37.</note> </p>
<p>Not until evening did the grandmother enter her hut, calling at once: "My little grandson, where are you? Come to me quickly, I bring you many big fish!" But she got no reply. The old man said to his wife: "Our grandson is no longer here." "But didn't he come back?" asked the grandmother. "Certainly he came back," the old man replied. "But he was very angry. He just painted himself with ími and ran out into the forest without saying a word. I don't know where he is now." The old woman became very sad at this. Soon the two old people began to cry bitterly, for they were very fond of their little grandson. A long time went by, but the little grandson never again returned from the forest. Finally the two old people put on mourning paint and went into the forest to look for him. Crying, they searched everywhere; they climbed the hills and shed many tears. The tears became small brooks which are still flowing today. They are the tears of those old people crying over their grandson, for whom they are still searching the forest in vain. </p>
<p>Old Wekatànaxipa was the first woman to use the téši as a sinker on the fishing line, that is, the black round stone of porphyry with a shallow groove. Since then several other women have also acquired the téši and use it for fishing.<note>In this story the explanatory elements are the night heron's predilection for big fish and the origin of the many small brooks on the hills.</note> </p>
