<p>Now Raven called all the birds to a great feast. He painted each one a different way, - the hawks, the owls, the eagles, the jays, and all birds, great and small. He painted Robin red on the breast. He painted Bluejay blue, and tied up his hair in a knot on his head. He tied up Ruffed-Grouse's hair in a knot. He painted Bald-Headed Eagle white on the head, neck, and back, and the rest of his body black. And thus he painted all the birds in different ways. He told the birds, "I called you to a feast. Now I will cut up the bear and feast you." Now he changed his mind about feasting them, and instead he worked himself up into passion and wanted to fight them. They became afraid, and all ran away. So they have kept the colors in which he painted them until the present day. Those who had their hair tied up now have crests on their heads. </p>
