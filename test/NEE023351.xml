<p>Taʼ Kokògn lived alone in a house some distance away from the rest of the people. One day he went to a friend's house in the nearby large settlement. "I want to see a live tiger," he said to his friend. "It is very ugly<note>The word used is yabod which means ugly, bad, dirty.</note> to look at," his friend told him. " I want to see one," he insisted. Everyone said that a live tiger is an ugly sight, but Taʼ Kokògn insisted that he wanted to have a look. He returned home; and on the way he came across the remains of a human being that a tiger had devoured. He picked up the liver which was untouched and took it with him home. He put it on a tree stump outside his house. Then he went inside and sat down to wait for the tiger. In the evening the tiger arrived. It went to the area underneath the house where it lay down and went to sleep. Taʼ Kokògn peered at the tiger through the slit bamboo floor. "Ugly," he said to himself, "a live tiger is truly ugly." He tried to poke at the tiger with a piece of rattan, but the tiger slept on. He then threw some grit at it, but the tiger did not stir. Taʼ Kokògn, feeling it would be safe to descend, went out and started to run for his friend's house. On the way a tiger attacked him, but Taʼ Kokògn managed to kill it with a spear. He ran on, and arrived at the big settlement shaking with fright. "There is a tiger asleep underneath my house," he told everybody, "and it is very ugly." So all the people went to have a look at the tiger. On the way they came across the corpse of the tiger that Taʼ Kokògn had killed. "There is another one under my house, still alive," he told them and they moved on. When they arrived at the house the tiger was not to be seen anywhere. "Oh, it has gone away," said Taʼ Kokògn disappointed. He did not realize that the tiger he had killed was the same tiger as had been under his house. It had only pretended to be asleep and had followed after him when he ran away. </p>
