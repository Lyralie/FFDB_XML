<p>The two Yoálox went hunting as often as they needed meat. They always killed birds with their slings. All this was too troublesome for the elder Yoálox who found this most inconvenient. One day he said to his brother: "I would like it better if we killed birds by merely a glance; a bird we stare at ought to fall dead on the spot. So be it, then: <pb n="33"/>whoever needs the meat of birds shall fix his eyes sharply on a bird, and kill it in so doing. This way everybody can catch his quarry without effort and carry it home!" The elder Yoálox promptly gave it a try. Just then some birds were flying overhead. So he turned his sharp eyes on them, while simultaneously wishing them to fall dead to the ground. And that is precisely what happened; the birds instantly crashed down before him, dead. The elder Yoálox was overjoyed and said: "From now on it shall always be like this, and we shall also tell the people about it: he who stares at a bird to make it instantly fall dead shall always be successful. In this way we'll save ourselves much bother and trouble, lengthy journeys, and many dangers." These words reached the ears of the younger Yoálox. He was thoroughly displeased with his elder brother's plan and angrily opposed it. He said to his brother: "It is much better for the people to have them make weapons and tools for themselves and let them go hunting with them. They should make an effort and use cunning when they sneak up on the birds and surprise them in order to kill and seize them. This is how it shall be, everybody must work and trouble himself!" </p>
<p>These words of his younger brother put the elder Yoálox into an extremely bad mood; but he did not reply. On the following day he attempted once again to kill birds by merely glancing at them. A whole flock of them was just flying overhead. He quickly stared steadily at the animals, wishing them to fall dead. They kept on flying, however, unharmed. Disappointed and discontented the elder Yoálox followed them with his eyes. Since then every man, too, must use much cunning and effort when bird hunting. Quite frequently the quarry escapes the clumsy hunter. </p>
