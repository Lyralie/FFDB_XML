<p>There once lived a widow. She had a son by her deceased husband. They were both living in his uncle's hut. But the uncle treated his nephew very badly and gave him little to eat. So the nephew grew thinner from one day to the next. Instead of good food all he ever got <pb n="67"/>from his uncle was a kéti.<note>A kind of blood sausage which the Yamana find tasty (Gusinde 1937:584).</note> Although the casing was made from the intestines of guanaco, the blood inside was collected from the noses of several people. They poked around in their noses with a small stick until blood flowed.<note>The Selknam amuse themselves with this unusual play during the men's secret festival, pretending before their wives to mistreat certain spirits. The Yamana do the same thing during the kína (Gusinde 1931:914).</note> It was this strange kéti that the uncle gave his nephew to eat. Precisely for that reason the little boy was getting very thin. Neither did any of the other people treat the little boy with kindness; nobody gave him anything to eat. </p>
<p>Finally the boy was unable to stand this mistreatment any longer. He had often complained to his mother: "My uncle gives me only a little bit to eat, and even what he gives me is bad. I'm so miserable from this that I can't stand it any longer!" Finally the mother advised him: "Then go hunting yourself and try to kill a guanaco." He answered: "How can I go hunting when I have no kíli [sandals]?" The mother then cut a piece of leather from her mašakána [loincloth] and made her son a pair of sandals. He put them on and hurried out to go hunting. </p>
<p>He promptly headed for a high mountain ridge. But his uncle had always said: "That mountain ridge over there is very high; nobody can cross it! It's a pity, for on the other side there are always many guanacos." Then the little boy said to himself: "I'll try to cross that ridge anyway. Maybe I can hunt a guanaco on the other side!" Thus he got close to the hill and began to climb. He crept forward and killed several large animals. Afterward he looked around and saw that the mountain ridge had completely disappeared. He was tremendously happy over this and said: "How wonderful! Now I can get back to my hut quite easily and quickly." He rested a little while. Then he loaded a guanaco on his shoulders. More he really could not carry, for he was still a child, and after all, not very strong. He left the other guanacos he had killed behind. Planning to return for them the following day, he had put them all together in a pile. </p>
<p>The boy did not return to his mother until late at night. She was very happy when she saw him arriving with a large guanaco. He immediately cut off several big pieces, and the two began to eat. Their neighbors in the adjacent huts soon heard how those two were crushing big bones with a stone and sucking marrow. They marveled among themselves: "Who could have given them the meat? One can clearly hear the old woman smashing big bones to get at the marrow." Finally several women went over to that hut and saw the large guanaco lying <pb n="68"/>there. The old woman immediately invited her visitors to help themselves and eat with them. "My little son has just brought in this large guanaco," she explained. "He killed it himself!" The women laughed and shook their heads in disbelief. They said: "How could a child this small have killed such a guanaco and carried it here? Besides, how is he supposed to have carried it here from the other side of the mountain ridge, which is not accessible even to a strong man." After they had eaten well they went back to their huts. Everywhere they related what the old woman had told them. Then the others, too, called the old woman and questioned her. She confirmed everything and even gave everybody a good piece of meat from the guanaco. Still nobody believed what she said. Finally she replied: "Why don't you go tomorrow to the other side of the mountain ridge. Then you can see for yourselves the many guanacos my little son has killed and left behind because he couldn't carry them all!" </p>
<p>The old woman went back to her hut where she told her son: "The people didn't believe what I said. So I finally suggested that tomorrow they go there themselves and fetch the many guanacos you have killed and left behind." The small boy, however, did not like that; after all, he had been treated badly by these people and so was unwilling now to share his catch with them. Nevertheless, many men went out with the boy the following day. They easily passed the place that his uncle had always said nobody was able to cross and then, a short distance on the other side, he showed the men the guanacos he had killed the day before. Indeed the animals were still completely fresh; not even the intestines had been taken out. Therefore the men could no longer doubt that this little boy had really killed all those guanacos. </p>
<p>Now the boy loaded a big guanaco on his shoulders and started on the way back. Each of the men also picked up a guanaco. With this they set off. But soon they noticed that their guanacos were getting very heavy. They had to rest all the time and progress was slow. Only the boy seemed not to notice the burden at all and soon left the rest of the men far behind him! It vexed them that the little boy was advancing so rapidly while they themselves had to rest every instant, exhausted. They hardly took a few steps when they had to sit down and rest again. Again and again they got up; but just as quickly did they tire again. They worked so hard and grew so exhausted that all of them turned into kuhúrux.<note>The big eagle owl, Bubo magellanicus (Gusinde 1937:42).</note> </p>
<p>Actually only the little boy made it back to his hut within a short time. When the other people in the camp saw him arrive with a big <pb n="69"/>guanaco they begged him for meat. But he told them: "I can't give you any of my guanaco. Wait a while until the other men, your relatives, who left with me this morning, get back. After all, you never gave me anything to eat either. So just wait for your relatives!" And they waited for a long time. But the eagle owls did not arrive until late at night. They brought nothing at all. They approached the huts where they and their relatives lived but did not enter. They also came to the hut where the little boy and his mother were sitting. They could see how the two were eating, but they did not receive anything nor did they enter. They only called: "Kuhúrux, kuhúrux." Then they went away and stayed in the forest forever. Even today they still come to the huts at night. But they do not come in and nobody gives them anything. They only call: "Kuhúrux, kuhúrux," then leave the huts and return to the forest. </p>
