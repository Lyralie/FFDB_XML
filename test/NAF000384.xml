<p>The baboons espied ǁχábbitẹnǁχábbitẹn, as he was coming away from the white men whom he had been to visit. He was carrying flour, which the white men gave him. And the baboons said: "Uncle ǁχábbitẹnǁχábbitẹn seems to be returning yonder; let us cross his path [?], that we may knock him down."</p>
<p>The baboons did so; ǁχábbitẹnǁχábbitẹn thought he would speak to them, he asked them what they were saying. And ǁχábbitẹnǁχábbitẹn remarked upon their foreheads' steepness [?].<note>"Ye speak to me! ye are ugly! your foreheads resemble overhanging cliffs!" The baboons became angry with him, because he derided them; he said that their foreheads resembled overhanging cliffs. And they broke off sticks, on account of it they went towards ǁχábbitẹnǁχábbitẹn.</note> And the baboons angrily came down to ǁχábbitẹnǁχábbitẹn; they <pb n="257"/>broke off sticks, with which they intended to come to beat ǁχábbitẹnǁχábbitẹn.</p>
<p>The baboons' children also came; going along, they called out to their parents about it: "O fathers! ye must give us ǁχábbitẹnǁχábbitẹn's head that we may play with it."</p>
<p>ǁχábbitẹnǁχábbitẹn did as follows, when he heard that the baboons' children were speaking in this manner, he thought to himself, 'What shall I do? for the baboons are not a little numerous.' He thought, 'I will climb a krieboom, that I may sit above in the krieboom; the baboons will have [?] to drag me down from the krieboom.'</p>
<p>And the baboons went up to him, as he sat above in the krieboom; the baboons' children spoke to each other about it, they said: "First look ye at ǁχábbitẹnǁχábbitẹn's big head; we should be a Iong while playing there, with ǁχábbitẹnǁχábbitẹn's head; for ye are those who see that its bigness is like this; it seems as if it would not quickly break." A baboon, who was grown up,<note>The name of the head baboon, the big, old one, which goes after the rest, is ǃụhāīǀhŏǀkwã, or "Schildwacht".</note> spoke to the baboons' children; he questioned the baboons' children: Did not the baboons' children see that ǁχábbitẹnǁχábbitẹn was grown up-that they who were children should think that they could possess the pieces of ǁχábbitẹnǁχábbitẹn. They spoke as if he were their little cousin; that they should possess his pieces. Did they not see that those who are grown up would be the ones to get the pieces of ǁχábbitẹnǁχábbitẹn those who are grown up?</p>
<p>And ǁχábbitẹnǁχábbitẹn thought to himself: 'What shall I do, [in order] that the baboons may <pb n="259"/>leave me? for, they speak angrily about me. it sounds as if they would really attack me.' And ǁχábbitẹnǁχábbitẹn thought to himself: 'Wait, I will first tell about the baboons to the white men. For baboons are not a little afraid of a gun; I shall see whether they will not be afraid, if they hear that I am talking about them to the white men.'</p>
<p>And ǁχábbitẹnǁχábbitẹn called out, - while he deceived them, - he said: "O white men! the baboons are here, they are with me, ye must drive them away" [?]. And the baboons did thus, when they heard that ǁχábbitẹnǁχábbitẹn spoke about them, that the white men should drive them away [?], the baboons looked about, on account of it. And the baboons ran, leaving ǁχábbitẹnǁχábbitẹn; and he escaped, at the time when the baboons went away in fear, he quickly descended from the krieboom. He ran away, as he escaped from the baboons; while they ran to the cliffs he ran away.</p>
