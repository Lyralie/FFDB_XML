<p>In the beginning of things, man and the animals came out in this way, at least so the Bechuanas say. At Sechele's Town there is a big hole called Lǒǒwe, which goes down a long, long way. It is so deep that if you take a stone and drop it down the hole, you can hear it falling for a great while, but you never hear it get to the bottom; so nobody knows how far it goes down, for we never try to get to the bottom, as we are very much afraid. In this big hole the animals and the men were together at first. But the hole was far too small for them after a while, and they were constantly quarrelling for want of room, and each wanted to push the other out. At last they were so angry that the men began to drive the animals out, and the animals would not go, so the men had to drive them out backwards. As fast as they drove them out, they tried to come in again; but at last they quite drove them out. Now the ground at the mouth of the cave was very soft, there was a river, and some reeds growing there. The animals, especially the cattle, made much spoor, and the ground was much cut up with their tracks. The animals were very much afraid, and did not go very far from the mouth of the cave. They stayed round about the hole the first night. By and by, however, they all wandered away, and began to eat the grass round about the place, and so they forgot all about the hole. After a time the men began to be so many that there was no room for them, and so they began to quarrel, and so they drove each other out; and when they were going, they <pb n="80"/>destroyed the spoor of the animals, so that you cannot see the spoor any more. If you go to the cave at Lǒǒwe you will see that what I tell you is true, and it is the end of the tale. </p>
