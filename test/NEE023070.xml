<p>Said the tiger to the fox: "Let us run a race from the top of the world to the bottom of the world, and he who wins it shall be lord of the world!" The fox agreed, and off the tiger bounded, but without noticing that the fox had caught hold of his tail so as to get pulled along by him. Just as the tiger was about to reach the other end, he suddenly whisked round, in order to jeer at the fox, whom he believed to be far behind. But this motion exactly threw the fox <pb n="19"/>safely on to the far end, so that he was able to call out to the astonished tiger: "Here I am. What are you so long about?"</p>
<p>For this reason there are no tigers in Aino-land.</p>
