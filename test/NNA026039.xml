<p>Now Raven turned back from the Mink people, and travelled north again. Now he showed the people the best places to fish, and made some fishing-places better for fishing. He built a house of timber like those the Tlingit use, and told the people to construct similar houses to live in. Before this they had used shelters and camps of various kinds, and some people had no houses at all. He established villages in the most suitable places for the obtaining of food and for shelter. </p>
<p>He tried to make a good place for the Katce始de people at Kake,<note>These people are said to have been Athapascan (Tahltan), who migrated to the coast and settled at Kake. Later most of them migrated back again, and to-day their descendants form a large part of the Tahltan tribe. (Compare Tahltan Indians, pp. 16, 17.)</note> to be their headquarters. He wanted to make for them a country without much rain, similar to the interior; but he did not succeed. He then said, "I will take these people back to their home in the interior." He told them to go up the Stikine River and wait for him; and when he reached them, he would make for them a good dwelling-place. After a while he came up the Stikine River, and made a house or camp for himself on the south side of the river, just opposite the mouth of Tahltan River. The remains of Raven's house may be seen there now as a cave in the cliff.<note>Swanton, BBAE 39 : 118 (Tlingit).</note> It was changed into stone. He put up his large robe as a wind-break for his camp-fire, so that smoke would ascend right; and this wind-break may now be seen in the <pb n="212"/>form of a long cliff<note>See RBAE 31 : 575, No. 107 (Haida).</note> on the opposite or north bank of the river, west of the mouth of the Tahltan. Raven tried to make a large, fine, level place opposite his house on the north side of the river, just east of the mouth of the Tahltan, and attempted to build a bridge across the Stikine from this level tract to his house. The bridge always fell down or broke, and all that remains of it now is a rocky point extending out into the river. He tore up and destroyed all his work. The level place he had made with considerable labor he also tore up. This place is now all rough and cracked, and is known to the whites as the "Lava Beds." Raven was angry and disappointed. He told the Katce始de, "I am tired, for I have travelled and worked too much. I am not able to do any good work. I cannot make good houses and village sites for you, as I have done for the Tlingit." He made a brush- house, and said to them, " You will live in this kind of house even when it is cold weather. Camp where there is plenty of dry wood, so that you can have good fires. There will always be plenty of dry wood in this country for you to use." This is why the interior Indians [Tahltan and others] use brush-lodges, and camp in a different spot every winter, according to the supply of fire-wood to be obtained. Much fire-wood is required to keep warm in brush-houses during cold weather. Raven said that the country around the mouth of Tahltan River would be the headquarters of the Tahltan tribe [or of the Raven or Katce始de clan].<note>There is a Katce始de or Raven phratry, and also a Raven clan, among the Tahltan. It is not clear whether the phratry or clan is meant here, but probably only the clan.</note> To the west of the mouth of the Tahltan, near the trail, may be seen Raven's tracks, and also the place where he urinated, both transformed into stone. </p>
