<p>The Porcupine was tracking buffalo. Where many buffalo had defecated, he asked the buffalo chips how long ago they had been defecated. "Long ago," they told him. He kept asking them until he found one that said, "I was defecated lately." From there the Porcupine started again. The tracks soon became fresh, and he followed them until, just as he got to a river, he saw a herd that had crossed the ford, coming out on the other side. "What shall I do?" thought the Porcupine, as he sat down. Then he called out, "Carry me across!" "Do you mean me?" said one of the buffalo. "No; I want another than you," said the Porcupine. Thus he rejected the herd one after another. When he had refused all, the best one in the herd said, "Do you want me?" "Yes," said the Porcupine. Then this buffalo crossed the water and asked him, "Will you be carried <ref target="g:GEE2143.035">riding</ref> me?" "No, I will fall into the water," said the Porcupine. "Then ride between my horns." But the Porcupine said, "No, I will fall into the water if I do that." </p>
<p>When the Buffalo had suggested all other ways of carrying him, he said, "Perhaps you would rather go inside of me?" Then the Porcupine said, "Yes." So he entered the Buffalo, who went into the river. "Where are we now?" asked the Porcupine. "In the <pb n=271>middle of the river," said the Buffalo. After a while the Porcupine asked again. "We have nearly crossed," said the Buffalo. Then he said, "We have emerged from the water; now come out of me!" "No, go a little farther," said the Porcupine. Soon the Buffalo said to him, "We have gone farther now; so come out!" Then the Porcupine hit his heart with his tail. The Buffalo started to run, but fell down right there. Thus the Porcupine killed him. Then all the rest of the herd tried to hook the Porcupine with their horns, but he sat under the ribs and they could not reach him. Then the buffalo desisted and ran off. </p>
<p>The Porcupine came out. "I wish I had something with which to butcher it," he kept saying. Now Coyote was sleeping there. Waking, he heard him. "What does he mean saying, 'I wish I had something with which to butcher it?'" Coyote thought. He went to him. "Here is my knife for butchering," he said. Then they went together to where the buffalo lay. "Let him butcher it who jumps over it," said Coyote. Then the Porcupine ran over a rib; but Coyote jumped clear over it. Thus Coyote beat him in jumping, and began to cut up the buffalo. But first he defecated near the river. After a time he gave the Porcupine the paunch, saying to him, "Go wash it, but do not eat of it!" So the Porcupine took it to the river. After washing it he bit off a piece to eat. Then Coyote's excrement said to him, "Eat of it!" After a while Coyote himself came after him. [Seeing that his excrement had said the very opposite of what he had instructed it to say, and that the Porcupine had eaten of the paunch, he became angry.] He said, "I did not tell you to eat this. I forbid you to eat it." Then he killed the Porcupine with a club. Placing him beside the buffalo, he left both there and went home. When he arrived he said to his family, "I have killed a buffalo. I have killed the Porcupine. Let us carry them home." </p>
<p>Now the Porcupine said, "Let a red pine grow fast." Then a red pine grew up under all the meat. It grew very tall. The Porcupine climbed it and sat in the top. All the meat was in the top. The Coyote's family came there. All the meat was gone and the Porcupine too. They began to look for it. "I wish they would look up," the Porcupine said. Then one of them, a child, looked up. He said, "Oh!" Then the rest looked up. There sat the Porcupine with all the meat. They said to him, "Throw down a piece of the neck." "Yes," said the Porcupine to them. "Place that youngest one a little farther off." "Yes," they said, and placed him to the side. "Now all hold up your hands," said the Porcupine. So they held up their hands. Then he threw down the buffalo neck, which, striking, killed all of them. Then the Porcupine <pb n=272>went down and took the youngest Coyote. He brought him up into the tree and gave him much meat to eat. After a time the young Coyote was compelled to defecate. The Porcupine said to him, "Go out on the limb." "Here?" asked the Coyote. "No, farther out," said the Porcupine. Again he asked, "Here?" and the Porcupine said to him, "No, farther out." At last the young Coyote was at the end of the limb, where it was flexible. Then the Porcupine kicked the limb hard and shook him off. The young Coyote fell down and broke to pieces. </p>
