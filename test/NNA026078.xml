<p>A long time ago a man went hunting goats on Spatsīʼz River.<note>A stream forming one of the southern head waters of the Stikine River. The name is said to mean 'goats painted,' because the goats get their hair stained by the rocks in this vicinity.</note> He carried a spear, and was accompanied by his dog. The dog ran down the goats; and when he brought them to bay, the hunter speared them. The man saw a young goat, and chased it. The goat ran and down a steep and dangerous cliff; and the man and dog followed it but they could not overtake it. When they reached the bottom of the cliff, the man was angry. He scolded the goat and told him to go back to his father's house. The goat then jumped up on a little rock and stood there. The man and dog jumped up also to attack him. Immediately the rock grew up into the air in the shape of a tall pillar, steep and smooth on all sides. As neither the man, nor the dog, nor the goat, could descend, they all stood there together on the summit. </p>
<p>As the man did not return, the people looked for him, and found him standing on the top of the tall rock. He called to them and told them his story. He said, "I am punished for abusing the goats. Never do as I have done. The animals will take revenge. Now I am here. I cannot get down, and you are powerless to aid me. I must stay here with my dog and the goat. I shall die and be turned into stone. When I see people approaching, I shall shout at them. They will look at me and remember my fate, and it will be a warning for them to treat the goats properly. After a while, when I become older and more feeble, I shall whistle; and still later, when I am almost completely petrified, I shall no longer be able to utter a sound, and you will know I am really dead." The figures of the man, dog, and goat may still be seen on the top of this rock-pillar. Formerly the <pb n="242"/>man held a spear, but this has now disappeared. Formerly both legs were visible, as if he stood with legs apart; but now they are the same as if one. Formerly he shouted at people. This was about six generations ago. Later, in our grandparents' days, he only whistled. Now people say he is really dead, and makes no sound. The name of the man or rock is Tenqalatīʼya.<note>Said to mean 'walked on arrow' (as if one met or walked against an arrow-point which pierced the body).</note> </p>
