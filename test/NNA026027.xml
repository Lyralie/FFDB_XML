<p>Raven now went to a village of people, and asked them if they had any olachen. They answered, "No we have no olachen. It is in possession of a man who lives a little distance from here." Raven went to the house that had been pointed out to him, and entered. The owner believed that Raven was a distinguished person, and treated him hospitably. Plenty of food was placed before him, but very little olachen. Raven went out, and went to Sea-Gull, who had eaten olachen, and to Heron, who had also eaten olachen. He said to Sea-Gull, "Heron talks evil of you, and calls you bad names." Then he went to Heron, and told him that Sea-Gull called him bad names. Thus he caused them to quarrel. He told Heron he would help him fight Sea-Gull. Heron said, "I push back the heads of people when I fight, and break their necks. I have done that often." Heron attacked and fought Sea-Gull, and broke his neck. Sea-Gull then vomited up all the olachen that he had in his stomach, and Raven gathered it up and put it into his canoe. He also gathered up broken shells, and put them into his canoe to make it look greasy and as if covered with fish-scales. He also rubbed shells on his arms to make them look as if they were covered with fish-scales. </p>
<p>Now he went to the owner of the olachen, and entered his house. No one spoke to him. At last Raven said, "I am tired," and Olachen-Man asked what he had been doing. He answered, "I have been working at olachen." The man inquired where he had found them; and Raven answered, "You are not the only person who has olachen. I have plenty at my place." Olachen-Man sent down some men to look at his canoe. They saw the olachen there, and what looked like the scales of fish all over the inside of his canoe. They came back and reported that the canoe must have been full of olachen. The houseowner then thought that Raven must be a great man, and that it would be better to treat him well. He placed before him as much olachen as he could eat. He took the precaution, however, of locking <pb n="204"/>him up in the house, intending to keep him until he had digested all the olachen that he had eaten; but Raven flew out of the smoke-hole and over to a tree near a stream. Here he vomited, and threw the olachen into the mouth of the stream, saying, "Henceforth olachen shall frequent the mouths of rivers, and all the people may eat them." </p>
