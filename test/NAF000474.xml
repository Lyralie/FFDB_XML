<p>One day the rabbit said to the tortoise, "Let us run a race," and the tortoise said, "All right." Now the tortoise being a slow runner, made up his mind to tell all his friends to help, and. they said, "We will." Now they all came, so before the race started he put one about every hundred yards or so. Then they began to run. The rabbit ran very fast, and then called out, "Where are you?" and the first one shouted out, "Here I am." So off he ran again and went on for a bit and shouted out, "Where are you?" and the second one answered, "Here, I am." So he started off harder again, and after a bit, feeling sure he had outrun the tortoise, he called out, "Where are you now?" and the third one answered, "Here I am." The rabbit ran on to the winning-post and again called out, "Where are you?" and a tortoise sitting at the winning-post called out, "Here I am." The rabbit was surprised, but he said, "Shake hands, you are a very slow runner, but you have beaten me this time. I asked you to run a race, as I was sure I could leave you behind." </p>
