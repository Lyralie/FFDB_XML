<p>(The story of Tcixʼqaʼ.<note>"Tcixʼqaʼ" is said to be the name for the camp or lodge which adolescent boys use.</note>)</p>
<p>A number of young men were living together in a camp or lodge such as young men use at the age of puberty. Nearly every day they went hunting. One of them never killed any game, and the others laughed at him. In the same place lived a wealthy man who had a young marriageable daughter. He thought it was time for her to marry; and one day he said to her, "Carry a dish of food to the young men's lodge. Give it to the best hunter, and then sit down beside him<note>Thus proposing marriage.</note> and become his wife. You will be able to tell the best hunter by examining the young men's hands. The one who has the <pb n="226"/>darkest mark at the base of the thumbs<note>It is believed that good hunters have darker skin on the part of the thumb adjoining the palm than poor hunters.</note> is the best hunter." The young man who was an indifferent hunter happened to overhear these instructions. He went to the camp-fire and blackened the front part of his thumbs with charcoal. Then he sat down among the other young men and exposed his thumbs, that the girl might see them. In the evening the girl came, peered in through the brush of the lodge, and looked at the hands of the young men. She noticed that Tcixʼqa"s thumbs were much darker than any of the others: therefore she entered the lodge, gave him the food, and sat down beside him. On the following day all the young men went hunting. They staid out two days; but, as usual, Tcixʼqaʼ had no game. They all laughed at him, and said that marrying had not changed his luck.<note>It is believed that marrying often changes a person's luck.</note> After his marriage he left the young men's camp and went to live with his wife and father-in-law. He went hunting with the latter, but never killed anything. His father-in-law thought this was strange for a man chosen as the best hunter of all the young men. He resolved to watch him, to learn why the youth did not kill any game. He saw him going after a caribou. He just ran a short distance, then stopped and walked on with long strides, to make people believe by his track that he had been running. The father-in-law went home, and said to his daughter, "Now I see what your husband does. He is no good. He cannot run, and therefore he never gets any game." At last Tcixʼqaʼ felt bad because he could get no game. He cut his anus and pulled out about a yard of his intestines, cut them off, and put them in a bag. Then he plugged the hole with moss and went home. When he reached there, he threw down the bag beside his wife, and told her to cook the contents. His wife said, "He has killed game at last," and hurried to cook it. Her father stopped her, saying, "It smells bad. Let him cook it himself! There is something wrong." He hung the intestines on a stick above the fire to cook. When he reached up, the plug fell out of his anus, followed by his entrails and blood, and he died right there. This is why to-day women always fancy the best hunters, but some choose and marry men who are very poor hunters. Also this is why lichens [Cladonia bellidiflora] have red tips, for the man used them as a plug. The red are the blood-stains. </p>
