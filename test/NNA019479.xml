<p>He arrived at Gwāʼᵋnālālis. Then Q!āʼnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ pretended to be an old man. He sat down by a water. "Wash, wash, child of Gwāʼᵋnālālis!" [he thought]. Then the children of Gwāʼᵋnālālis came. They were four girls. They saw Q!āʼnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ. Then one of the children of Gwāʼᵋnālālis said, "A nice little one is sitting on the beach. He shall be my slave." Thus said the oldest child of Gwāʼᵋnālālis. She took water and washed herself. Then she called Q!āʼnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ. "Come, wash my back," said the oldest child of Gwāʼᵋnālālis. Then Q!āʼnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ washed the back of the girl. Then Q!āʼnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ took gum and put it on his first-finger. Then he touched with his first-finger the womb of the child of Gwāʼᵋnālālis. He touched three of them from behind with his finger, but he did not want to touch the one. "Why is this one so daring? Do I know where you come from?" - "You will have her for your wife," said Q!āʼnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ [referring] to the youngest child of Gwāʼᵋnālālis . Then he married the child of Gwāʼᵋnālālis.<note>"That means I will have you for my wife," thought Q!āʼnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ in regard to the youngest daughter of Gwāʼᵋnālālis.</note> Then the older sisters of the wife of Q!āʼnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ became pregnant. Then the wife of Q!āʼnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ became pregnant, and she had a child. </p>
<p><pb n="197"/>Then Gwāʼᵋnālālis spoke. "Let us go and split boards." Thus said Gwāʼᵋnālālis. Then they paddled. They saw what was to be split. Then Gwāʼᵋnālālis drove in wedges, and the cedar-tree opened. Then the hammer dropped. It fell into the cedar-tree. "Come get our hammer. It dropped in," [said Gwāʼᵋnālālis]. Then Q!āʼnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ took the hammer. Gwāʼᵋnālālis knocked out [the spreading sticks. The tree] clapped together, and blood came out, and Q!āʼnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ was dead. Then he saw the blood of Q!āʼnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ. He took the wedge and put it into the wedge-bag. "Serves you right! You came to make me ashamed." Gwāʼᵋnālālis started, carrying his wedge-bag. Then Q!āʼnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ, came, carrying the hammer. "Why are you going away?" said Q!āʼnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ. Gwāʼᵋnālālis said, "Come, let us go and do our work!" Gwāʼᵋnālālis came and began to drive in his wedges. Then the cedar tree opened. It was spread out. Then the hammer dropped in. "Come get it! My hammer dropped in." Then Q!āʼnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ went into the cedar and got it, and Gwāʼᵋnālālis knocked out the spreading-stick of the cedar tree. It clapped together, and blood came out. "Serves you right! You came to make me ashamed. You did not see what I was going to do to you." Gwâʼ?nâlâlis started. "Don't go away!" said Q!āʼnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ. "I am bringing your hammer." - "Oh, that is good, my dear!" said Gwāʼᵋnālālis. "I thought you were dead." Then they finished their work and paddled home. </p>
<p>Then Q!āʼnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ threw rotten wood into the water. Q!āʼnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ said to the rotten wood, "You shall become dolphins." Then the rotten wood began to jump and became dolphins. They came and jumped at the head of Gwāʼᵋnālālis. Then his face began to swell. His eyes could not be seen because he was swollen. That was done by the dolphins. Then Q!āʼnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ took salmon <pb n="199"/>berries, and put the berries into a bucket. Then he paddled, going home. He took the salmon-berries and gave them to his mother-in-law [his parent-in-law; namely, his woman parent-in-law] to eat. Then Gwāʼᵋnālālis was hurt. </p>
<p>Q!āʼnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ lay down in the house. "Why are you downhearted?" said the wife of Q!āʼnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ; and Q!āʼnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ spoke, and said, "The reason that I am downhearted is that Only-One is probably dead." Thus said Q!āʼnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ. Then Gwāʼᵋnālālis spoke. "Go and see him," Gwāʼᵋnālālis said to his child, "only take your chamber-vessel." Thus said Gwāʼᵋnālālis to his child, the wife of Q!āʼnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ. Then he started to see his younger brother. Now Only-One was dead. Then Q!āʼnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ cried on account of his younger brother, when he was dead. The flesh of Only-One was all gone. There were only bones. Then the wife of Q!āʼnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ took her chamber-vessel and sprinkled Only-One. He came to life. "Hë!" said Only-One, "I have been asleep for a long time." Thus said Only-One. "You did not sleep," said Q!āʼnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ to his younger brother Only-One, "you were dead." </p>
<p>Then Lord Q!āʼnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ spoke. I am going to start again. I have seen much that is wrong, that I will set right." <epimyth>That is the end.</epimyth> </p>
