<p>Léxuwakipa,<note>The strong rusty brown spectacled ibis, Theristicus melanopis. See also narrative 6 in this volume.</note> who was very touchy, felt offended by the people. In revenge she let it snow so much that an enormous mass of ice came to cover the entire earth. When it eventually began to melt there was so much water that the earth became completely flooded. That woman intended to destroy the whole world and all the people in it. The glaciation occurred precisely at the time of the great upheaval of Yáiaašága, when the men battled against the women and seized the kína. </p>
<p>After the glaciation the whole earth became flooded. The immense mass of water rose steadily and rapidly. All the people hurried to their canoes and embarked to save themselves. The water rose higher and higher, up to and over the mountaintops, covering them one after the other. Finally only five peaks remained above water. The enormous flood came so quickly and with waves so high that the people were unable to provide themselves with food; many did not even reach their <pb n="28"/>canoes, and nearly all of them perished in the immense floods of water. The misery everywhere was indescribable. For someone who failed to escape in his canoe early enough and hold on in a sheltered place there was no salvation. </p>
<p>Lucky were those who in their canoes reached one of the five mountaintops that towered above the waves. There they found safety. Those mountain peaks: [1] Ušláka, in what is today Bahía Packsaddle, by the Hardy Peninsula. High up there one can still see broad horizontal stripes that indicate the level reached by the great flood of that time. [2] Wémarwaia, across from Isla O'Brien. There one notices an indentation that encircles the rock in its entirety. It came about because initially people had tied up many canoes there, most of which were destroyed anyway. [3] Auwáratuléra, in a hidden corner of Estero Ponsonby. There even today stands a thick stake to which a few canoes were tied in those days. The massive stake has turned into stone, as it has been standing there for a very long time. [4] Welalánux, on Isla Gable. The peak there used to tower even higher but with the violent waves constantly pounding against it, it has become considerably lower. [5] Piatuléra, two steep hills on both sides of the mouth of the Rio Douglas. Today they are no longer as high as when the great flood covered all the land. </p>
<p>After the enormous flood had reached its highest mark leaving only the five peaks barely uncovered, the water level remained steady for two full days. Then it subsided and rapidly lowered. Practically all the Yamana had drowned; only a few families had managed to save themselves. Once the great flood had subsided those few people began to rebuild their huts on the shore. Ever since that time the men have ruled the women. </p>
