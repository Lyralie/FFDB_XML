<p>Once the people went to the river to collect water. They carried it in bamboo. A man from the land near the sea had arrived in the jungle. He turned himself into a piece of sweet smelling wood, taba.<note>The taba tree which is used for all ritual purposes (<ref target="g:GEE2143.027">Ã²z taba</ref>) has a strong scent. It is associated with special powers and said to "be people." In this myth, we learn that taba people are superhuman beings.</note> A young girl who was also carrying water found the piece of wood. It smelled very nice so she brought it with her home. Once it was inside her house the piece of wood became a man again and he and the girl slept together. They became husband and wife. After a while the girl's mother came to visit her daughter. She saw that the girl was pregnant. "Do you have a husband?" she asked. "I do, mother," replied the girl. The child was born. When it was big enough to walk, the husband wanted to return to his own land: He had been away for a long time and he missed his mother. One morning he, the wife and the child set off. In the evening they built a lean-to on the ground and went to sleep. The following morning, very easily, while the wife was still asleep, the husband got up. He took all the things they were carrying with them and, pointing in a direction, told his child, "That is our path today, I am going ahead." When the wife woke up she looked around for husband. She asked her child, "Where is father?" "Over there," said the child pointing in the direction the father had indicated. So the wife strapped the child to her back and set off after her husband. She knew the way by following the scent of the taba. By evening she caught up with him. He had already built the lean-to for the night. "I just walked on ahead," he replied when she asked what had happened. They ate and went to sleep. The next morning, while the moon was still in the sky, the husband got up, gathered together their possessions and, pointing, told his child, "That is our path today." When the wife woke up she asked the child where the father was. "Over there," said he, pointing out the path the father had taken. So the wife followed the scent as she had done the day before, and by evening she caught up with her husband. He had a lean-to ready for them and they ate and went to sleep. The next morning, while it was still dark, the husband got up, packed their things and told the child, "This is our path today." When the wife woke up, the child pointed out the direction the father had taken and the wife followed the scent of the taba. She reached her husband in the evening and they ate and went to sleep. </p>
<p>The next morning, while the moon was still shining in the sky, the husband got up, gathered together their things and set off without telling the child the direction he was taking. On the way he passed the house of a wild pig and the house of a monitor lizard. </p>
<p>When the wife woke up and saw that her husband had gone, she asked her child, "Which way has father gone?" The child did not know. He had not looked. The wife set off, but the scent of the taba had finished and she did not know the <pb n="51"/>right direction to go. She walked and walked, and in the evening she arrived at the wild pig's house which was on the ground. "Where are you going?" asked the pig. "I am following my husband," replied the woman. "Your husband has gone that way," the pig told her, pointing, "but it is late so you can sleep in my house tonight." The woman and the child entered the house. The pig offered her some long worms saying, "Have some snake meat". Worms are meat for pigs, but the woman would not eat any. "l don't want any," she said, "people cannot eat worms, it is Pantang, to do so is dirty." She ate only some wild roots that the pig dug up for her. The next morning she set off in her search of her husband, and in the evening she arrived at the monitor lizard's house. "Where are you heading?" the lizard wanted to know. I am following after my husband," said the woman. "Your husband has gone that way," said the lizard, pointing, "that is his path. But it is late, you can sleep in my house tonight" His house was high up in a tree. There was a ladder, so the woman climbed up, but as she could not get through the entrance to the lizard's house she slept on a branch. The lizard gave her some fruit to eat. The next morning she climbed down with her child and set off. It was very hot and the child went to sleep. They met an eagle. "Sit down here with me for a little while and have a rest," said he. "No, am following after my husband," answered the woman. "Your husband has gone that way, but it is very far," said the eagle. After a little while he asked, "Do you have any fishing hooks?" "Yes," replied the woman. "Do you have any rings?" he then asked. "Yes." "If you give them to me I will take you to your husband's land," said the eagle. The woman agreed and the eagle told her to sit on his back. The woman and the child placed themselves on the eagle's back and he flew them to her husband's land by the sea. When they arrived the eagle landed and when the woman and the child had descended, he said, "Give me the fishing hooks and the rings." The woman offered to have sexual intercourse with him instead, but the eagle did not want to. "The fishing hooks are my meat and the rings are my eyes,<note>Often a shaman makes rings of leaves before entering the other worlds. These he puts in front of his eyes, and it is because of these that he can see in these other worlds. There is an association between this practice and the eagle's desire for "eyes" in the form of rings.</note>" he said, and the woman gave them to him. "Over there is the house of your parents-in-law," he said and then he flew away. The woman went over to the house. Her husband was sitting on the area underneath the house talking to his friends. He did not see his wife approaching. The woman entered the house, and her mother-in-law, who did not know who she was, offered her tobacco and betel nuts. The woman spat some of the betel juice through the split bamboo floor onto her husband. He looked up angrily and shouted, "Betel nut juice is hitting me" He saw his child's foot which was dangling through the floor. "Oh, that is my child," he cried out. He entered the house. "What, you have a wife and child and you returned alone!" exclaimed his mother angrily. "How did you get here?" he asked his wife. "The eagle carried us. If it had not been for the eagle, we would not have got here," she replied. So she accompanied her husband to his own house. <pb n="52"/>Everybody came to have a look. "You have a child?" they asked. "I do," said he.</p>
<p>After a few days the husband returned to his mother-in-law's house in the jungle and asked if she wanted to move to the land by the sea. "Is your land good?" she asked. "It is good" he replied. So he carried his mother-in-law to his land by the sea, and all the people in her settlement followed. They all settled down by the sea where they planted <plant latin="manihot utilissima">tapioca</plant>, hill rice, sweet potatoes, bananas and sugar cane. </p>
<p>"Maybe there still are our people by the sea," said Modn as she finished telling this story. </p>
