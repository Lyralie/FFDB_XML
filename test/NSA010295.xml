<p>In the old days, to cover their bodies women wore only their mašakána<note>The loincloth is described in Gusinde 1937:406; cf. ibid., p. 408, fig. 16. For the women's back cover see Gusinde 1937:405.</note> and a short cover hanging down the back. They always took off the back cover when inside the hut. There once lived a woman who had a little son. One day her husband went out to hunt for several days. As usual, the woman devoted herself to her work in the hut. She did not pay too much attention to herself whenever she bent down, but her little son was watching her attentively and could see her private parts from behind. He took great pleasure in this and thought about it constantly. From then on he cried over and over: "I like that thing there! I like that thing there!" Since he was constantly crying the same words his mother wanted to let him have his wish. She brought edible mussels and snails, sea urchins and crabs, fish and berries, showed him one after the other, and offered it to him kindly. But discontentedly he rejected every single thing, turned away his head, and only repeated: "I like that thing there!" At the same time he pointed to his mother's private parts, but she did not understand what he wanted. She brought <pb n="74"/>little baskets and necklaces, feather ornaments and beautiful stones, weapons and tools, even small birds and a small dog. But the boy angrily rejected all this and turned away from it, saying again and again: "I like that thing there!" Finally the mother was completely at a loss and embarrassed; she no longer knew what to do. She was unable to discover what her small son really wanted and could not understand why he was always screaming: "I like that thing there!" She had shown and offered him everything within her reach, but nothing had calmed him down. </p>
<p>Finally the mother pretended to be very tired. She lay down and acted as if she were going to sleep, for she expected her little son soon to fall asleep, too. He did indeed remain still, likewise pretending that he was going to sleep. The mother got up after some time and looked for her baskets, talking quietly to herself as she went: "I'll go to the beach now to collect mussels." She took her basket and left the hut. Just a few steps from the hut she came across some big mussels. She bent down and gathered them in her basket. Meanwhile her little son had half sat up on his bed and turned his eyes on his mother. When she was thus gathering mussels in a bent-over position he again saw her private parts from behind and was delighted. He quickly got up and painted his head, his face, and the upper part of his body all black with charcoal dust, but his legs he covered with ími [red soil for painting]. He left the hut and hurried down to the beach where his mother was. He went by some women who were also gathering mussels. Unobtrusively he looked at their private parts from behind but did not touch any of these women. When he was standing close by his mother he put his hand on her genitals and began to play with them. He liked this play very much and it increased his pleasure. His mother liked it, too, and she gave in to him. But so that the other women would not notice what the two were doing to each other they hurried to their canoe, got in, and went over to an island nearby. Here they were all alone. They lay down and had intercourse. They stayed together for a long time in this way. During this they were eventually transformed into birds. </p>
<p>The following day both left the desert island and flew back to the shore where the huts of the people were. Here they sat on a stone exactly in front of the hut where they had lived until the day before. In the meantime the man had come back from the hunt, and when he could not find his wife and his son in the hut, he anxiously inquired among the other people: "Where are my wife and my little son? I see them neither in the hut nor elsewhere." The people answered him: "Just look at that stone: two birds are sitting there that were not there before. <pb n="75"/>Those two šékus<note>The powerful, heavy wild goose, Chloëphaga hybrida (Gusinde 1937:43).</note> are your wife and your little son. They fell head over heels in love and were turned into birds." Since that time the two accompany each other constantly and, to this day, live together exclusively by themselves.<note>This story signifies that sexual intercourse between mother and son is completely unnatural and impossible among people; indeed, it is only among animals that it occurs. The so-called explanatory element in this myth lies in the couple's strictly monogamous life. | During a short discussion I pointed out that the female of the species Chloëphaga hybrida has a black head and front whereas the male is completely white. Old Julia, whom I have to thank for this myth, replied: "We know very well that the šékus male has all white feathers and that the female is colored mostly black. However, the old people have always told us the story the way in which I just repeated it."</note> </p>
