<p>The first time we saw wagons was when the ǂkhuñ [Trek Boers] went up to Ñgabee [Lake Ngami].<note>The Bushmen call Lake Ngami Ñgabee, the giraffe.</note> We thought the wagons were big animals. There were <pb n="85"/>many oxen going before, and these big animals were going after, as we thought. Some of the old Bushmen had seen such things before. They looked like elephants, but they were white. We watched them a long time, and we saw that some of them stopped. There was not much rain that year, and the grass was not good. The oxen were thin, and then they died. Many died before they got to the lake, and sometimes we had some of the flesh., At last one day we saw some of the ǂkhuñ take all the cows out of the wagon, and leave it on the veld. We were afraid to go near it. We thought they had left it to graze, but we saw that its feet did not move. Some got near then, and we looked in. There were lots of things inside, but we Bushmen did not know their uses, and so we left them. We found some dry meat, which we took. Then we went on after the others, and by and by we were near to the wagons, so the ǂkhuñ got their horses and they galloped after us. Three of us were caught. They tied up our hands, and they told us to take them to the water. I was young, then. They tied us up at night, but one of us got away in the darkness. After a time all the cattle died of sickness, and the ǂkhuñ got sick and died too. They left the wagons. At first when we saw them they were living in the wagons. Many of the ǂkhuñ were killed, many died, and others went away. Some of the women were taken by the ǀ ghare [Bechuanas], but I don't know what they did with them. We Bushmen never killed any of these people, but we took their cattle and ate many of them. The wagons died on the veld, and some of them were burnt. That is what I knew of the N1chuil. It is the end of the tale. </p>
