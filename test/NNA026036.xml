<p>Now Raven came to the house of Pitch-Man, who was the only person who knew how to catch halibut. He owned a halibut-hook, which he kept hidden. The people did not know how to make halibut-hooks. Raven said to the man, "I will help you with any work you have to do." He agreed, and Raven did a great deal of work for him. Raven noticed that he always went to a cool shady place when the sun rose or when it was warm weather. He slept in the shade all day, and in the cool of the evening he went fishing. He always returned from fishing before sunrise. One day Raven said to him, "I will help you fish." They went to sea, and Raven steered the canoe. Pitch-Man fished, and always kept his hook in such a position that Raven could not see it. They fished all night. When daylight came, the man wanted to go home; but Raven refused, saying that they had not caught enough halibut. Shortly before sunrise he told Raven that they must go home, and he looked anxiously in the direction where the sun would rise. Raven said, "We will go soon, we will catch just a few more fish." They continued fishing. Presently the man became sleepy, and was hardly able to talk. At last he fell sound asleep. The sun rose, the wind quieted down, and it became very hot. Then Raven saw that the man had melted. Raven went home, took the melted pitch, and threw it to the trees, saying, "Henceforth pitch will be found in the wood of trees." Now he examined Pitch-Man's hook, showed it to the people, and they copied it. After this people had halibut-hooks and could catch halibut. </p>
