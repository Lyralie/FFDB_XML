<p>Once there was a young girl who went to the river to bathe. In the evening she took ill. She became worse and worse. Two, three days went by and she had become very ill indeed. She only wanted to die. The <ref target="g:GEE2143.032">putao</ref> came to the house. They said to the girl's mother that if she was feeling energetic, she should make all the preparations for a <ref target="g:GEE2143.025">nöpoh</ref>. "Yes, I am energetic," she told them, and she made headbands of different kinds, <ref target="g:GEE2143.035">riding</ref>, <ref target="g:GEE2143.036">ruwai</ref> rope etc.<note>In order to conduct a proper <ref target="g:GEE2143.025">nöpoh</ref> certain ritual paraphenalia are necessary. The <ref target="g:GEE2143.032">putao</ref> wear headbands made of leaves. Plaited loops called <ref target="g:GEE2143.035">riding</ref> are attached to the headbands and are hung from the roof. The bi hali sit in these when they arrive. A plaited string is fixed across the room, along which the <ref target="g:GEE2143.036">ruwai</ref> of the <ref target="g:GEE2143.032">putao</ref> travels.</note> In the evening all the people in the settlement came to help with the <ref target="g:GEE2143.025">nöpoh</ref>. The girls drummed and the men sang. There were three <ref target="g:GEE2143.032">putao</ref>. Each took it in turn to sing and search for the lost <ref target="g:GEE2143.036">ruwai</ref> of the girl. They had a <ref target="g:GEE2143.025">nöpoh</ref> for two nights. Then the <ref target="g:GEE2143.032">putao</ref> told the girl's mother what pantang<note>While pantang prohibitions are still operating after a healing ritual, a birth, or a death, people from other settlements are not allowed to enter the house.</note> she had to observe. But the girl was no better. She would not touch her food. They did another <ref target="g:GEE2143.025">nöpoh</ref>. Two, three nights they had <ref target="g:GEE2143.025">nöpoh</ref>. The <ref target="g:GEE2143.032">putao</ref> looked at the girl. They saw that she was just as ill as she had been. They tried to offer her food, but she would not eat any of it. The women were very tired, the men were very tired. All the people with hot eyes were tired. They did not want to continue with the <ref target="g:GEE2143.025">nöpoh</ref>, they only wanted to sleep. </p>
<p>One evening they heard "klesseck, klesseck on the area underneath the house. "What is the klesseck, klesseck noise under the house?" the people asked each other. They looked down. Somebody was there. "Oh, it is people! Enter the house," called out the girl's mother. "No, I won't. I am very ugly," replied a man's voice. It was Bongso Lanogn. "Come up," she insisted. "No, I won't. There is pantang," he said. "No, the pantang is finished," said the mother, "but disease is still with us. My daughter is very ill." So he entered. He was truly very ugly. His eyes were infected and his body was not straight. When they saw him all the people said "Ugly! Unclean!" Especially the young girls; they would have nothing to do with him. But the girl's mother gave him boiled <plant latin="manihot utilissima">tapioca</plant> to eat. "I am very sad," she told him, "your sister<note>The Chewong apply the kin terms tòh [older sibling] and adi [younger sibling] to non-relatives who they wish to include within the kin system, and who are of a similar age. Those of parents generation are addressed as aunt or uncle, and those older still as grandfather or grandmother.</note> is so ill," Bongso Lanogn asked her what had happened. "Oh, your younger sister went bathing in the river and she has been ill ever since. Do you want to help?" she asked. "I do not know how," he replied, "but I will help with the preparations." When the girls heard that the ugly man was going to be present at the <ref target="g:GEE2143.025">nöpoh</ref>, they did not want to play the drums. The men said they would help, but the girls refused. In the evening they conducted the <ref target="g:GEE2143.025">nöpoh</ref>. The men sang. They asked if Bongso Lanogn wanted to sing also, but he refused, saying that he did not know how. Only the girl's mother was <pb n="29"/>playing the drums. "You sing also," she said to Lanogn. "No, auntie, not I," he said, "truly, I do not know how to <ref target="g:GEE2143.025">nöpoh</ref>." When all the men present had sung, they all went home to their own houses. It was late in the night. They all went to sleep. Then all Bongso Lanogn's 'wives'<note>This refers to Bongso's spirit-guides of the opposite sex. Shamans talk of these as their wives or husbands. In this instance they were all leaf people, bi hali</note> arrived at the house. Lobag-leaf women descended, tintin-leaf woman descended, chingchòng-leaf women descended, and they-all played the drums, and Bongso Lanogn sang. All the people who had gone home woke up when they heard the singing and the drumming. Many leaf women (bihali) had descended and the drumming was very loud. People asked each other who was singing. They went over to the sick girl's house to investigate. But they could see no one, and Bongso Lanogn was fast asleep. They could not see the leaf women nor tell that Bongso was singing. Then Bongso's <ref target="g:GEE2143.036">ruwai</ref> went in search of the sick girl's <ref target="g:GEE2143.036">ruwai</ref>. When his <ref target="g:GEE2143.036">ruwai</ref> had gone his hieng<note>Hieng (meaning not known) is a different kind of spirit guide. Only the great shamans have one. A hieng enters the body of its "father" and merges with him, yet is separate, as can be seen from the fact that when the shaman's <ref target="g:GEE2143.036">ruwai</ref> have gone on a journey the hieng takes over, and continues to behave as if the <ref target="g:GEE2143.036">ruwai</ref> was still in the body.</note> were singing. The <ref target="g:GEE2143.025">nöpoh</ref> went on until dawn. Then all Bongso's wives returned to their own houses in the leaves. When Bongso woke up, the people asked him what the singing and drumming in the night had been. "I don't know," he replied, "I was sleeping. I did not hear anything." </p>
<p>In the morning the sick girl was feeling much better. She could sit up and she ate a little <plant latin="manihot utilissima">tapioca</plant>. Bongso Lanogn wanted to move. "Where are you going?" asked the mother. "Oh, I just want to walk around a little," replied he. "You should not do that, the people do not like to look at your ugly body," said she, but Bongso went down and into the jungle. In the evening he returned. The girl's father wanted to <ref target="g:GEE2143.025">nöpoh</ref> again that night. This time all the people, including all the girls and women, came to the house. They wanted to see if the same thing would happen again. When they stopped singing arid drumming, the leaf women descended and played the drums, and Bongso Lanogn, who looked as if he were asleep, sang. The people could not see what was going on. They tried to feel if there were somebody there, but their hands did not touch anything. They all had hot eyes so they could not see the leaf women. They could only listen. The leaf women sat in the <ref target="g:GEE2143.035">riding</ref> and played the drums. The next day the girl was fully recovered. She wanted to eat meat. "Your younger sister wants to eat meat," the mother said to Bongso. "Oh, I do not know how to hunt, auntie," replied he. But he went fishing. In the evening he returned with one small fish. "This is all I could catch, auntie," he said giving her the fish. She cooked it, but when she came to serve it, the saucepan was full of fish. "What is this?" she said, "I only put one small fish in and now there are many." Bongso said that he did not know how this had happened. Since the girl was well again they did not <ref target="g:GEE2143.025">nöpoh</ref> any more. </p>
<p>One or two months went by. The people were going to make spear traps to <pb n="30"/>catch wild pigs. The-father asked Bongso to make some as well. "No uncle, I do not know how to make them," said he. "Yes, make a few with me. Your younger sister wants to eat meat." "No, uncle, really, I don't know how to do it," he insisted. So the uncle made traps on his own. He built several on the area underneath the house. In the evening he did a <ref target="g:GEE2143.025">nöpoh</ref>. He sang. He also asked Bongso to sing, but he would not. But when the father was singing, Bongso's <ref target="g:GEE2143.036">ruwai</ref> went and brought lots of wild pigs to the traps. In the morning when they looked out they saw many pigs lying dead on the ground underneath the house. The other people who had also made traps under their own house had not caught a single pig. Only the father's traps had caught pigs. </p>
<p>A few days later the girl and Bongso Lanogn got married. All the people went to look at the husband with the ugly body. After a few days the new husband went to the river to catch fish. His followed him. She said to herself, "I think it was he who has been singing beautifully, I want to see what he is doing when he goes into the jungle." When she reached the river she hid behind a banana tree and watched her husband take off his 'ugly cloak' before he stepped into the water. He threw the cloak behind him, straight into the wife's hands. She took it and went home. She put the cloak in the fire and it burned up. When Bongso Lanogn saw that his cloak had gone, he ran home asking everybody "Where is my cloak, where is my cloak? Who has taken my cloak?" The wife said that she had burned it. "You must not wear the ugly cloak," she told him, "it is so difficult when you have it on." She gave him a real shirt to wear instead of the ugly cloak that she had destroyed, and from then he was a handsome man. </p>
