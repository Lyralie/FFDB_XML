<p>When the birds had all left, Raven turned to the trees and the roots of upturned trees, and offered them a present of the bear. He said, "I will feast you with the bear-meat the birds would not eat." The trees and roots became angry, because they knew Raven was fooling them. Then a tree fell across the bear, covering it up, and nearly hitting Raven. Now Raven said, "I have done wrong. I should not have done this. I should not fool people. People must not fool or joke to the trees or rocks, or game, or anything in nature, for these things will seek revenge." This is why Indians are careful not to offend anything. If they make fun of a tree, they may get hurt by a tree; if they mock or fool <pb n="210"/>with the water, they may be drowned; if they laugh at the snow, a snow-slide may kill them. </p>
