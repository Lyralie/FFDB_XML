<p>Once the Dipper called down to the people, saying, "My grand-children, I will tell you something. Watch me, and as long as you see me going around, everything will be well with you, and you need not be afraid; but if I get lost, light will nevermore come to you, all of you will die. It is nothing if the moon is lost, for it will not be for long; but if I am lost, I can nevermore come back." For this <pb n="229"/>reason the Indians watch the Dipper whenever there is an eclipse and if they see him going as usual, they say, "Everything is well."</p>
