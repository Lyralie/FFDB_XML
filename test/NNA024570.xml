<p>Coyote had a sick daughter. He thought the Duck had done something against his children, in order to make them sick. He determined to injure the Duck. Going to him, he persuaded him to run to a certain place with his eyes shut. The Duck did so. When he opened his eyes again, he found himself in a bad place. He was in a hole in the rock, a little cave high on the face of a cliff. There was no way out. Coyote went and took the Duck's wife and children. He maltreated the children. He urinated upon them. Soon he had children of his own from the woman, and these he took good care of. </p>
<p>For a long time the Duck could not get out of the bad place. At last the Bat camped near this place, and every day when he went to hunt rabbits, his children heard some one crying. They told him, and he went upward to look. On the way he killed rabbits and hung them by their heads on his belt. At last he found the Duck, who was very weak. "Who is there?" he asked him. "It is I," said the Duck. "Who are you?" asked the Bat. "I am the Duck." "How did you come up here?" the Bat said to him. The Duck said, "Coyote caused me to come here with closed eyes. He brought me here in order to get my wife." Then the Bat told him, "Throw yourself down." The Duck was afraid that he would be killed by the fall. So the Bat told him, "Throw down a small rock." The Duck threw down a rock, and the Bat caught it on his back. He said, "That is how I will do to you. You will not be hurt." The Duck feared that the Bat would not do so to him. The Bat continued to urge him. Several times the Duck almost let himself fall, and then drew back. At last he thought, "Suppose I am killed; I shall die here too; I am as good as dead now." So he shut his eyes as the Bat commanded, and let himself fall. The Bat caught him gently without any shock, and deposited him on the ground. Then he took him to his home. He said to him, "Do not use the fire-sticks that are near the fireplace, but use those that are stuck behind the tent-poles, at the sides of the tent." Then they <pb n=273>entered. The Duck saw the sticks at the sides of the tent, but thought them fine canes, that were much too handsome for stirring the fire. Around the fireplace lay a number of sticks that were charred on the end. He took one of these and stirred the embers. The stick began to cry, and all the other sticks called out, "The Duck has burned our younger brother." These sticks were the Bat's children, and they all ran out now. Then the Duck became frightened at what he had done, and went out and hid in the brush. The Bat came out and called to him, "Come back! You have done no harm." For a long time the Duck was afraid that the Bat would punish him, but at last he thought, "I have already been as good as dead; so there is nothing to fear even if they should kill me." So he went back into the tent. But the Bat did not harm him, but gave him plenty of rabbits to eat, so that soon he was strong again. </p>
<p>Then the Duck said, "Coyote took my wife and children; I think I shall look for them." Knowing that he was strong again, the Bat allowed him to go. The Duck went to his old camp, which he found deserted. He followed the tracks leading from it, and after a while he found also tracks of children other than his own. "I think Coyote has already got children of his own from my wife," he thought, and he became very angry. Then he came up with his wife. She was carrying a very large basket. Inside of this were Coyote's children, well kept; but the Duck's children sat on the edge of the basket, nearly falling off. They were dirty and miserable. The Duck caught the basket with his finger and pulled back. "What are you doing there, children?" the woman said. "Do not do that. You must not seize something and hold me back." The Duck continued to pull, and at last she turned to look at the children: so she saw him. He said to her, "Why do you take care of Coyote's children, while mine are dirty and uncared for? Why do you not treat mine properly?" The woman was ashamed and did not answer. Then he asked her: "Where will you camp now?" When she told him, he said, "Go to the place where Coyote told you to camp, but when you put up the shelter, make the grass very thin on one side, and very thick and heavy on the side on which you are, so that I can reach Coyote." </p>
<p>The woman came to the place and Coyote arrived there also. He said, "To whom have you been talking now?" She said, "I have not met any one nor talked to any one. Why do you always ask me that?" Then she put up the shelter as the Duck had directed her. Then the Duck began to blow. He blew softly; but again and again; thus he made it freezing cold. Coyote could not sleep. He took his spear and thrust it through the sides of the shelter in all directions. He nearly speared the Duck. He said, "I knew that you <pb n=274>met some one. It must have been the Duck, who is now making it so cold." The Duck continued to blow and blow. At last Coyote dug down into the fireplace, hoping to become warm there. But it was of no avail. He froze to death. </p>
<p>Thus the Duck got his wife and children again. Taking Coyote's children, he threw them away here and there in the brush, and said, "Why do you take care of these? I do not want them." Then went back to where he had lived before. </p>
