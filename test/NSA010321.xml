<p>Once Marutuwérelakipa<note>A sea bird of average size. This bird plays the principal role also in the preceding story.</note> came with her family to a small lonely island, and the fire went out for all of them. Sadly they sat there not knowing what to do, for they did not even have šewáli [firestones] with them. They suffered badly from the cold, because there was exceedingly heavy snow and the winter was unusually severe. Full of despair they huddled in their cold hut. One evening when it had grown very dark many touwíšiwa<note>The magnificent Phalacrocorax olivaceus.</note> quite unexpectedly arrived and sat there on the beach. They talked to one another just as the Yamana speak and had a lively conversation. As soon as they arrived they said: "Here we'll make a fire and rest!" And indeed, it was not long before a bright fire was blazing. All this the people saw and heard. The women moved closer, for they wanted to warm themselves by the fire. Now they could understand very clearly what the touwíšiwa were saying. They were <pb n="154"/>talking about their long journeys, about the frequent bad weather, about the islands and bays they had visited; they also remarked how comfortable they were feeling there by the fire and that they were going to continue their traveling the following day. They felt so snug and comfortable by the fire that they kept shaking themselves all the time. </p>
<p>Meanwhile the women had gotten quite close to the birds. They were delighted with the gleaming embers and planned to steal a few firebrands. Very cautiously some of them extended their hands toward the fire. But when they wanted to take a few burning logs and pull them away from the hearth the compact flock of touwíšiwa suddenly flew up. All flew high up into the air and soon were out of sight. Although the women became very frightened they soon calmed down at the thought of the fire they had been without so long. But when they looked more closely at the fire which they already considered theirs, it was only dry grass and not real fire at all. Disappointed, they said to one another: "What is this? After all, we did see fire and reached for it; now we're only holding dry grass in our hands!" Others said: "Those birds did have real fire, we all saw it. They talked just as we do. They also said: Tomorrow we'll catch a lot of fish and then make a fire again on that other island there!' They were all feeling so comfortable here by the fire, which all of us clearly saw. And now we have nothing but dry grass in our hands!" They grew extremely sad, for again they were without fire. But the birds never came back to this island; nor did they ever again appear in that region. </p>
