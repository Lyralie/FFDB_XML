<p>The tradition [of] the woman [with] a toothed 'vagina'. </p>
<p>[Once upon a time] five men went to the sea to catch seals. After [a time there] was a fog, [they] lost [their] way, came to a village, [and] went up to a house. The master of the house rose, took the head of the master of the boat, pulled him, lifted [him] up, killed [and] roasted [him] before the fire, setting [him] on a spit. After [that] the master of this house ate the flesh [of the man]. Thereupon the people who had lost [their] way returned to their boat. Bowing aimlessly in the sea, [they] landed on a land [where] there was a great mountain. </p>
<p>Thereupon [they] dragged the bout up the shore. A woman <pb n="86"/>came from the house [and said]: "[If you] men have lost [your] way, [that is] on account of me; [wishing for you, I] made you land [in] this country. Come [now] to my house!" Then the people entered the house of that woman. This woman prepared drugged soup [and] gave the people to eat. And the people [were] very satisfied.</p>
<p>Thereupon [the woman said]: "Sleep here in my house. When you go to bed, do not wish to have copulation with me. Because I am a pretty woman - [and] although all the gods loving me wish to marry me - [there] is an evil thing in my vagina, it is dangerous. You being men, if you love me, [it will be] dangerous". </p>
<p>Thereafter [they] made a bed to sleep [in]. By the side of this woman, near the corner of the back wall, two men made a bed upon a sleeping bench, [and] on the opposite sleeping bench two men slept. After [that] this woman also [went to] sleep. Thereupon a man wished for copulation, could not refrain. Thereupon [that] man again asked the others, [and] also [the other] people wished for copulation. Such being [the case] the people could not refrain. One man. a little after, <pb n="87"/>went to this woman; when [he] entered [her] bed, [there] was a noise of copulation. </p>
<p>Thereafter when [it] was near emission, in the time of emission, this man cried [out]. This woman wept [saying]: "Although I did not consent before, [they] wished for copulation; although I disliked [it], they had [their will and] now the man [who] made copulation has died". Now [she] dressed [the dead man] in a silk dress [and] laid [the body] upon the sleeping bench. Thereupon again the people [went to] sleep. Another man wished to have copulation, although he in every manner [tried to] refrain, when [he] could not, in the fit of [this] desire of copulation [he] rose [many times] and lay down [again]; and so at last [he] went to the woman. Again there was a noise of copulation. </p>
<p>Now in the time of emission, [his] penis was cut off and [there] was [heard] the groan of a dying [man]. Then this woman wept. Having finished weeping, [she] then sewed a silk dress, [and] dressed the dead man. Now two men were dead. This woman said: "You were four men, now two men having loved me, now are dead. Therefore again do not love <pb n="88"/>me, [it is] dangerous. Now you are onlv two men". Thereafter [they went to] sleep again. </p>
<p>Now again these two men wished to have copulation. One man rose many times and fell [back on the bed]. [He] took then from [his] bag a red whetstone, put [it] in his hand and went to this woman for copulation. Now [he] put his penis into the woman's vagina. Now [there] was a noise of copulation. When it came near emission, [he] took out [his] penis, {and there] was a noise as of putting the red whetstone into the vagina of this woman, and [after there] was a noise of crushing of the red whetstone in this woman's vagina. </p>
<p>Now this woman having risen, made a fire. Then thanks to the men, [those evil] things in her vagina were now broken and come out - [and] teeth came out. Now because it was owing to the Ainus [that] the [evil] things came out of her vagina, she was thankful to them. Now [to these] dead men this woman took out some tanne's - as [is] called a precious thing, - and laid these tanne's by the side of the two dead <pb n="89"/>men; and [she] dressed these dead men in many silk dresses, in many rich silk dresses. Thereupon [she said]: "When you landed here, having lost [your] way, two men died; notwithstanding, now being thankful to you, I give you these precious things. [That] being so, when you came to your country, do not put the precious things into the earth with the dead men, do not put in the silk dresses either with the dead men. [Of] these my things you will relate the story for all time. </p>
<p>Then when [we] go together to the sea-shore, you will put all these dead men into the boat. When [you] have done you will get into the boat; thereafter, when I remain upon the shore, you will go rowing seawards: if you go far, [and] this mountain which is in my country will descend beneath the sea, if I remain on the shore, if my body ascends to the clouds and if you seeing that [still] go on landwards, [then] you will [happily] land in your country". </p>
<p>One man rowed, one kept the steering-oar. When the people had rowed [a long time] and when [they saw] the <pb n="90"/>water was all above the land of the woman, [and] only the very peak of that mountain was [to be seen], it was dark. The next day the people looked towards the land of that woman, - that woman was standing in the clouds. Thereupon they, the rowing people, arrived in [their] country. Afterwards the people dragged the boat, [and] they bore the dead men to the house. Having brought [them], they took all the silk dresses off [and] dressed the dead men in other silk dresses; having accomplished [this] they laid all these precious things in another place, and instead of them [they] gave other precious things to the dead men. </p>
<p>Now when [this was] thus done, they carried out the dead men [and] buried them in the earth. Having finished, they told the tale about these precious things to the people; [that was] born later. The people [who] formerly did [these deeds] now are dead. Now the youths born later tell this tradition till the end of the world.</p>
