<p>Hánuxa had only one son. Like his mother he was extremely handsome and well built. He died very early and out of grief over her great loss Hánuxa made many small cuts in her face so that much blood flowed. That is why one sees her alone today, still colored red all over, a sign of her mourning.<note>Two known ways of expressing mourning are specified here, namely, painting and nicking the skin. The latter was more popular with earlier generations than with the Yamana of modern times.</note> Her son became a star; nobody knows his name. </p>
