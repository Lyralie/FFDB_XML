<p>Once there was an old blind man who travelled with his wife. When game was in sight, he drew his hand over his arrow, then his wife held <pb n="227"/>up his arms, and he shot, never missing his mark. One day he shot a caribou in this way, but his wife told him he had missed. She said, "You are useless now. I am going to leave you." She went to where the caribou lay, butchered it, and dried the meat. Meanwhile her husband was weeping bitterly. He crawled about, not knowing where he was going, while his wife had plenty to eat. He heard a loon cry, and crawled towards the sound. At last he felt the water of a lake. Loon came to him and asked him why he was crying. The man said "Because I have missed a caribou, and my wife has deserted me" Loon said, "Get on my back, I will take you along with me." The man was afraid. Loon dived with a rock on his back to the other side of the lake and back again. Again he dived with a heavier rock and returned.<note>Compare "Story of Cāʼkinā" (this Journal, 32 : 245).</note> Now the man climbed on Loon's back. Loon dived from one end of the lake to the other, and then asked the man if he could see. The man answered, "Yes, a little." Four times Loon dived with him; and when they came up the last time, the man had recovered his eyesight.<note>Some Indians believe that the loon is a good guardian spirit for shamans, and that those who possess it can cure eye-diseases.</note> Loon told the man to kill his wife for lying to him and deserting him. He went to her, and found her eating caribou-meat. When she saw him approaching, she said, "I was just going to look for you." He cut off her leg and killed her with it.<note>Stories telling how a person is killed with his own arm, leg, head, etc., occur among the Carrier.</note> </p>
