<p>These are the things I've heard and now I'm telling you. A group of people were living at a certain place. Was ǃGara a person who had no wife, or what? Because he didn't know about frogs. The women were killing frogs and killing frogs ... damn! (laughs), didn't ǃGara have sense enough to see what they were doing? The women killed frogs and killed more frogs and ǃGara was only killing toads. Then they all went home and built a fire to roast what they had killed. The women sat down around their fire and ǃGara sat a little apart and watched them. They busied themselves roasting their frogs. ǃGara lay his toads in the coals of his own fire to cook. After awhile, he took out the toads. They tasted bitter. ǃGara was surprised, and said, "What are these bitter-tasting things?" Then he jumped up and went over to the women's fire. He took away all the frogs the women had killed and roasted at their fire. The women sat and cried, complaining that he had stolen their frogs. ǃGara left them sitting there.</p>
