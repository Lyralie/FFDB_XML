<p>Once upon a time, as a man was walking in the forest upon the mountains and on the sea-shore, some cotton tried [happened] <pb n="94"/>to descend from the clouds [with] the end spread out into a tassel [of filaments attached to the] looped thong of a dog's collar. That the man happened upon; taking [that, he] made an inau, wrapped it up and hid [it] carefully. The talisman looked [down] upon this man every year. [That] being so, [he] succeeded [in all] the work [of his] hands. [That] being so, he sold well. After that whatever [he] sold to the Japanese [e. g.] the furs of different animals, [he] received payment [for] that, [and] quickly became a rich man. Hunting, every year he [was] more happy, [and] possessed everything [he wanted, and] became a rich man. Thus [runs] the tradition. </p>
