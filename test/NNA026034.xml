<p>Raven wanted to go to <pb n="209"/>war against Grizzly-Bear, and called all the young men together. All the birds came, and the smaller mammals. He dressed them and painted them for war. He armed them for battle. He painted some black, and put white and blue and yellow spots on others. He painted the head of the mallard-duck green, and the head of the loon as we see it to-day. He put a large necklace of dentalia on the loon,<note>For the white collar of the loon having been a dentalium-shell necklace, see Chilcotin (JE 2 : 35-36), Shuswap (JE 2 : 668); also known to the Carrier, Lillooet, and Thompson.</note> and smaller necklaces on some of the other birds. He tied up the hair of the bluejay and willow-grouse. He armed some of the birds with spears. These birds have long bills at the present day. The chipmunk he painted with stripes down the back, and he looked very handsome. Loon was to be war-chief, and Raven gave him a big spear to carry. This is why he has a big beak at the present day. Later he was changed, and Robin was made chief. Raven painted him all red in front. </p>
<p>When all were ready, Raven said he would feast them. He cooked a great deal of meat, and then ate it all himself. The birds were angry at this breach of faith, and Robin began to growl at Raven. Then the others began to growl. Raven became angry, and took up a stick and threatened them with it. They all then ran away, and hid in different places. The ducks went to the lakes, the grouse to the woods; some went to the mountains, and some to the rivers. Thus they were scattered. Before this the birds had all been together. Raven said, "It would not be well for all kinds of birds to be in one place. It will be better for people if the birds are scattered. Henceforth the birds shall be scattered throughout the country, and each kind shall live in a different locality." This is why birds are scattered over the country now, some kinds in the mountains, other kinds in the woods, and others in the marshes and on the lakes and streams. This is also the reason why the birds are marked and colored as they are at the present day. </p>
