<p>The two lána<note>The large woodpecker of the Tierra del Fuego region, Ipocrantor magellanicus. It has coal black feathers, and the male has a bright scarlet tuft. Couples live strictly monogamously.</note> were brother and sister. From their earliest youth they lived with their parents and grew up together. When they had grown a bit older they began to meet in a hiding place. Here they caressed each other and yielded to their desire. For a long time they secretly carried on their evil pleasure in this way. </p>
<p>The other people finally noticed that the two were meeting secretly. They became very upset over this, loudly criticized the evil doings of the brother and sister, and threatened them with severe punishment because of their disgusting behavior. But neither the boy nor the girl listened to people's scolding; they met secretly and carried on with each other as before. After a long time all the people were extremely angry and would no longer stand for the improper behavior of the brother and sister. They explained everything in detail to their parents. When the father heard this he became furious; he was beside himself with anger over what his degenerate children were doing. He summoned both of them, took some ími and painted his daughter's head with it. At the same time he said furiously: "Since you are doing such bad things you shall henceforth remain together always! Now get out of my hut!" </p>
<p>Then the two left their parent's hut and fled into the forest where they had been meeting for their evil doings. Since then those two, brother and sister, have stayed together and to this day live all by themselves as husband and wife.<note>After old Julia had finished this story I asked for some explanation. As is well known, Ipocrantor magellanicus shows a striking difference between the sexes in that only the male has bright scarlet feathers on his head. I pointed to this and asked whether she might not have made a mistake in speaking. She only replied: "The south-people tell this story as I have told it." Obviously this confusion of sex is of no importance. A year later I heard the following variant of this myth from Calderón, who belongs to the western group. In this, the animal with the head painted red appears as the brother, in closer agreement with the sex of this species of bird.</note> </p>
