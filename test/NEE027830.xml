<head>NEE027830</head>
<p>My grandfather brought me up. Whilst he brought me up, he went a-hunting seals, he brought [them] home. After, I lived [with him] one year; my grandfather, to get me food, again went forth to the sea to hunt seals. Now, when the time came [to be] late [in the] evening, he arrived home. Not even one seal had he brought in his boat. Then the voice of his speech was thus: "Having gone to the island where yearly I find food, there is not one seal [there]. Far in the open sea, I have heard - the cry of sea-creatures have I heard. </p>
<p>Old sea-creatures with [their] companions were crying [aloud]. I thought the old seals had migrated to some island [there]: [and] therefore upon the island where I formerly found food, [there] is not a single seal; not having killed, I came back". My grandfather, an elder, told me [this]. This <pb n="150"/>boy heard [those words]. After, I was fain, I only wished to go to that island. Nightly I could not sleep. </p>
<p>One night, my grandfather was sleeping; at that time, I went to the seashore. Near the sea, my grandfather's boat for seal-hunting - this boat I seized. Directing the boat towards the other sea [and] rowing [straight] before me, I saw an island before me; I came near, and landed on that island. There were many seals. From the end of the island there came a little mean-looking man. He chid me: </p>
<p>"Wherefore hast thou come to this island? This island is an island on which dwells a very evilly-disposed god. Wherefore then hast thou come? It is dangerous. Inside a cave, in these cliffs, hide thy boat, [and] leave the seals in the cave. Having placed [them] there, hide [them]. Now cometh the dangerous god of hereabouts. This island's god cometh now. Before that, hide thy body". </p>
<p>Now this god hath come. Now I have heard the voice of his questioning. "This boat - whose boat?" It was the voice <pb n="151"/>of Jajresupo speaking: That boat - is my boat, and therefore with a cord twisted to the left is it moored". - "That is thy boat, and yet it has a smell of man". - "I am half a man, half a god; and therefore my boat [is] as [the boat] of a man, [and it] has a smell of man". </p>
<p>That evilly disposed god said again: "Jajresupo, thou art [a] mighty [Magian], and therefore thou dost this; to-day, we shall compare our mights". Thus said the voice I heard. Afterwards, that god returned home. Jajresupo['s] voice said: "Child, to thy village swiftly flee [thou]. After, when thou goest, at the headland of this isle, cut out of alder and birch [and] make two 'inaus', and place [them] in the canoe. Then, out of the uita tree - the tree [loved by] this evilly-disposed god of the island - make one [other] such 'inau'. </p>
<p>I indeed from childhood have been friendly with thy grandfather, [and therefore say that] to come over to this land is dangerous. When thou settest out journeying through the midst [of the] sea, thou wilt hear behind thee a din of gods fighting. When upon thy canoe a little shower shall be sprinkled <pb n="152"/>from above. I shall be somewhat gashed. Afterwards again, when thou goest [further] and when thou seest that upon thy canoe the rain falls from above, I shall then have killed that evilly-disposed god. </p>
<p>Because thou art absent hitherto, thy grandfather is disquieted about thee. Disquieted about thee, he has gone out to the end of the road leading to the sea. And leaning on a staff, thy grandfather - knowing that I dwell on this island - prays that I may help". His words have touched the clouds, [making] a rainbow. Unto me did my grandfather's words of prayer come from above. I steered my boat beneath the rainbow. </p>
<p>When I looked, now near [my] village, my grandfather [was] on the seashore, leaning on his staff, his chin raised towards the clouds, and earnestly praying. Though I landed near him, he saw me not. Bearing in my right hand one of the seals [that] were in the boat, and in my left hand another, I flung them beside my grandfather. He was startled. I fell backwards, and then only did he perceive me. </p>
<p><pb n="153"/>Much pleased, he patted me on the shoulders, he patted me on the breast; he chid me: "Wherefore didst thou go to that island? Had he not been there, my friend Samajekuru, then should I not have seen thy body [again]". Then I went home. I flayed the slain seals; having cut up their flesh, and cooked [it], I fed my grandfather. Thereupon: "I am old, near death. When I die, then go hunting seals anywhere but in the island where thou hast gone now; it is most dangerous". After [is] the end.</p>
