<p>I want to tell my own stories now. I want you to hear them. Here is a story about Kauha and what he did. One day he was in the bush - I don't know whether he was out hunting - but he came upon the springhare. Springhare was at the waterhole eating ǂdedi. He was eating and dancing. He danced so well that Kauha watched him for a long time. He watched and watched and when the sun went down he left to go to sleep. When he left, Kauha said, "Tomorrow I'll borrow a loincloth from Kanǁa and ǃXoma and bring it to you so you can wear it when you dance. Then I'll watch you."</p>
<p>The next morning he got a loincloth from his son (when Kauha speaks of his son he doesn't mean one of them but means them both). When he got up in the morning he borrowed the loincloth. Then he came back to the waterhole. He came back and gave it to the springhare, and the springhare fastened it on. Then he danced. Kauha watched and the springhare danced, and Kauha watched and the springhare danced.</p>
<p>Then it began to look like rain. Kauha said "Give me ǃXoma and Kanǁa's loincloth so I can go home." But the springhare kept on dancing and kept on dancing. Kauha was indignant. The rain was close upon them and he had felt the first drops. "Koo!" he said. "Why doesn't this guy give me the loincloth so I can go? It's already raining on me and he's still dancing!" Kauha sprang to grab the springhare but he ran away. Kauha chased him to his hole and he jumped in. Kauha tried to grab him again but only succeeded in breaking off his tail. The springhare got into his hole and was gone. </p>
<p>Kauha went home. "I'll fix this guy tomorrow!" he said. He went home and the next day he made a hook. He made a springhare hook and came back to the waterhole. "Today I'm going to really wreck this guy," he said. He came back to the waterhole and there was the springhare. He was dancing again. He danced and danced in the dried-out loincloth (the rain had soaked it but it had dried). Kauha crept up on him and had almost got close enough to catch him, but the springhare saw him. He ran to his hole with Kauha behind him. The springhare went into the hole but Kauha poked in the hook and pinioned him with it. Pinioned him with it and tied it up tight to another stick while he dug through into the burrow. He dug the springhare out and beat him to death. When he had killed him he ripped open his skin and tore his body in pieces. Then he threw the pieces far and wide and said "Let springhares be in all the land and let there be springhare hooks in all the land so that people may have springhares to eat. What does the springhare think he's doing, to treat my son's loincloth this way?" So the springhares are now spread out everywhere for people to eat. That's the story of Kauha and the springhare.</p>
