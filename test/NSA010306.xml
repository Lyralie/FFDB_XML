<p>Once there lived a woman who very happily went out to sea every day to catch birds. Hidden in her canoe she had a young man with whom she was deeply in love. It was precisely because she wanted to be alone and unobserved with him that at the crack of dawn every day she went so gladly far out to the open sea. She never returned until late at night. But she always brought many birds to the hut and distributed them among all the people. The other women often asked her: "How do you manage to gather so many large birds every day?" She answered: "Well, where I go, I always find these birds, and recently killed, at that. I only have to load them into my canoe and bring them here!" The other women exclaimed in amazement: "How can that be? After all, we too go from one place to the other, looking around everywhere. Yet nowhere have we come across as many large and freshly killed birds as you bring back every day." She replied curtly: "Well, it's the truth, I just find all these big birds. One only has to look for them carefully!" Her lover was a skilled hunter; he knew how to handle the sling well. It was actually he who always killed the large number of big birds and who gave them to the woman. Every evening, therefore, she brought many birds to the camp. </p>
<p>One morning the woman went out again in her canoe to the open sea. When she was far enough away from shore another woman from the camp watched her, and she could clearly distinguish two people in the canoe. Immediately she called several other women and drew their attention to it: "Look closely over there! I can clearly make out two people in that canoe!" The other women confirmed: "Yes, indeed, we can also quite definitely discern two people in that canoe. Who knows whether some man isn't sitting there with her!" A shrewd woman added: "If there are really two people sitting in the canoe, one of them is likely to be a man. It must be he who kills all these big birds with his sling. He gives them to that woman and she brings the whole lot to the camp. Then she pretends to us: 'I found all these big birds out there; they were all still fresh and had recently been killed!' That's probably how it is." The other women nodded in agreement and wondered: "But who might that man be? For it's no delusion; we can clearly distinguish two figures in that canoe." </p>
<p>Thereupon all the women went to the woman's hut to see whether her husband had perhaps gone out to sea with her. But he had stayed home and was sitting by the fire warming himself. The women resumed their chatter among themselves and once again wondered: "Who might <pb n="106"/>that other person be who is sitting out there in the canoe with the woman? It has to be a man!" Finally the women went back to their huts. </p>
<p>In the evening the woman returned to the campsite in her canoe. Again she brought many large birds from her journey and distributed the big catch among all the women. They questioned her insistently: "Where did you get so many big birds again?" She replied: "I found them far out on the open sea. They looked so fresh, they probably had just been killed. I picked them up and brought them home." Whereupon all the women informed her: "Yesterday, we ourselves were exactly where you just came from, but we didn't find anything there at all. How come you alone were able to find so many big birds there today?" She insisted calmly: "It may well be that none of you encountered any birds there yesterday, but I actually did find all these birds there today and picked them up." </p>
<p>While the women discussed the matter the woman's husband listened to their talk unobserved. Shortly afterward the woman went off to look after her canoe on the beach. Meanwhile the other women sat down with the man and hinted to him: "Your wife must be having an affair with a stranger; early today we distinguished very clearly two people in her canoe! How else could it be possible that she regularly brings home so many big birds, while we find nothing at all?" A particularly shrewd woman added: "Something very strange is going on there! Who might that man be who so regularly accompanies your wife out to the open sea in her canoe. None of us have ever seen him get in." This talk upset the woman's husband and he pondered everything he had heard. </p>
<p>As always, the next morning the woman happily hurried down to the beach, got into her canoe, and went out to sea. As she went farther and farther out her husband kept a close eye on her. Then he returned to his hut without telling the other women what he had observed and what he was planning. Late in the evening his wife returned; as usual she brought back many big birds. Her husband was waiting for her on the beach. She hardly had the canoe out of the water and firmly settled when her husband jumped in and searched it closely. To his wife he said: "I see you have again brought many big birds today." She answered: "That's right! I was lucky again. I found all these birds out there and they had just been killed." He replied: "I'm very glad!" After a brief pause he continued: "But look here, your canoe takes in a lot of water! It would be good to plug up these big chinks right away!" His wife hastened to say: "That's really quite unnecessary! As far as I can see only a little water has come in; it is hardly worth stopping up these few cracks." But he insisted: "Still, it's good to fix everything right <pb n="107"/>away; later the chinks will grow larger and the canoe will be in danger!" Upset, now the woman resisted: "I don't see why I should give myself all this trouble tonight!" So the man said harshly: "Since you don't want to do it I'll start the work myself; I'll push aside and lift out the lúka,<note>Pieces of bark, bent to a half-circle, in the middle of the canoe.</note> then the ílax<note>Pieces of bark lying lengthwise directly on the bottom of the canoe (Gusinde 1937:447).</note> beneath them, and caulk the small chinks in the sides of the canoe." Anxiously now his wife implored him: "Spare yourself the trouble!" But he said: "It's necessary to take care of such small but urgent jobs immediately." Then she gave in and said sulkily "All right then, I don't care! If you absolutely want to stop up those small chinks I'll show you where they are. Look, they are right here up front!" "But that's impossible," replied her husband, "I can clearly see that the water enters at the stern." Before his wife could stop him he had lifted up a few pieces of bark at the rear part of the canoe. Here he saw a man hiding with his face turned upward. After all, he had to breathe, and therefore he lay face up on the bottom of the canoe where, in fact, there was some water. The woman turned pale with fright and terror. Her husband became livid with rage, seized a harpoon, and drove it into the body of his wife's lover, killing him instantly. The furious husband threw the body into the sea. </p>
<p>Husband and wife stole silently into their hut. The wife was so overcome with pain and grief that she could not eat. She uttered not a word and lay down. The following morning the husband sent his wife out to sea to fetch birds. This time she did not feel like going at all but finally went. She did not return until late at night, yet this time without a single bird. As usual the other women were waiting for her canoe to draw closer to shore, in the hope of receiving a share of her big catch. But to their disappointment they discovered that this time the woman had not brought one single bird. They burst out laughing and jeered: "Now look at her, everybody! Isn't it obvious now that she was lying to us all the time. It was her lover who hunted all these big birds and who gave them to her! And us she fooled: 'I found all these big birds; they had just been killed!' She had a lover hidden in her canoe; when nobody could see her she occupied herself with him, and they were together every day." The woman was deeply ashamed, said not a word in reply, and hid in her hut. Her lover became the watewémuva [i.e., in the western dialect; in the eastern dialect it is aporpánuwa].<note>A small, very common type of isopod.</note> He still swims on his back just as he had lain in the woman's canoe. </p>
