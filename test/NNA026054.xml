<p>Kᴇxtsāʼza<note>Kᴇxtsāʼza or kaxtsaʼᴇza, the mythological name of Rabbit-Man. The word has some connection with the Tahltan word for "rabbit."</note> was a rabbit or hare man who appeared in the form of a small, tame-looking rabbit. By pretending that he could be caught or that he could not run much, he lured people off to the ice of a lake [or river]. When the people got to the middle of the ice, he caused a fierce cold wind to come and blow the snow off the surface of the ice, which then became so smooth, that the people could not walk, and fell down and froze to death. </p>
<p>A number of boys went hunting rabbits in the winter-time, and saw a small, feeble-looking rabbit, which they chased. The rabbit kept just a little ahead of them, and led them to a large sheet of ice. A strong, cold wind began to blow, and made the surface so smooth that they could not return, and all froze to death. </p>
<p>The people told Raven of the death of the boys, and that Rabbit had killed them. Raven said, "I will go and see him. I can easily beat him." The people said that they did not think he could beat him. Raven went and met Rabbit. He asked him, "Can you swim?" and Rabbit answered, "Yes." Raven said, "I don't believe it. I can swim, but you cannot." Rabbit asked Raven if he could walk on ice; and Raven answered, "Yes." Rabbit then said, "Let us go on the ice!" Raven said, "Oh, no! not yet. You said you could swim. We shall try swimming first, that I may believe you, and then you will see me walk on the ice." Raven made a narrow strip of water for Rabbit to swim in. Rabbit was afraid to swim, and made ready to jump it. Raven saw what he was going to do, and, just as he jumped, made the water very much wider. Rabbit jumped, and fell into the water. He could not swim much, and soon was tired. He was about to drown, when Raven said, "Hold up your feet, and I will help you." Rabbit held up his feet, and Raven pulled off his sharp claws; for rabbits formerly had sharp claws or spurs on their feet, enabling them to run easily on the smoothest ice. Raven now put pads on Rabbit's feet, like the soft pads rabbits now have, and said, "Henceforth you will be able to run on ice just a little, and you will have no power of killing people." </p>
