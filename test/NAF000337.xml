<p><anamyth>The story of <animal>ǃʼõǃʼõ</animal>? I don't know it and I do know it ... </anamyth> The great god, the great god people call <persName>ǃGara</persName> was the one who spread out the land for us in the beginning. And the <animal>ǃʼõǃʼõ bird</animal> went about gathering honey. He would go looking for honey and when he found some he would fly into the <plant>tree</plant> and chop it out. He'd chop it out and then go sit on the ground with it. Along would come <persName>ǃGara</persName> who always sat down to beg for honey. But <animal>ǃʼõǃʼõ</animal> would pick up the pieces of bark he brought the honey down in and leave <persName>ǃGara</persName> sitting there and just go away with them.</p>
<p>Now one day <persName>ǃGara</persName> found some honey of his own. He found it himself and chopped it out of the <plant>tree</plant>. And this time it was <animal>ǃʼõǃʼõ</animal> who came to sit and beg for honey. <persName>ǃGara</persName> went up and down the <plant>tree</plant> several times. Of course he couldn't do it as easily as <animal>ǃʼõǃʼõ</animal> could. The third time he had almost made it up the <plant>tree</plant>, when suddenly he fell down and his stomach split open. The <animal>ǃʼõǃʼõ</animal> came and took the honey containers and ran off with them. <persName>ǃGara</persName> lay there with his stomach split open. Then little <animal>flies</animal> gathered all over him and began to repair his stomach. <apartmyth>(You know how <animal>flies</animal> do?)</apartmyth> They came and lay their little hands flat on his stomach and sewed it up for him. They sewed up his belly button and sewed up the skin over his liver. When he was all sewed together, <persName>ǃGara</persName> thanked them saying, "My nephews have saved me." Then he got up and was fine. <epimyth>Yes, that's what happened.</epimyth></p>
