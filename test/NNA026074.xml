<p>A long time ago, somewhere near the sea, there was a large village of people not far from a glacier. The people became sick, and all died except one man. He hunted, and carried in much meat. He wanted to give a feast for the dead, but there was no one to attend it. He invited the ducks and other birds to the feast, but they never responded. He called the trees and stumps, but they also gave no heed. Then he went to the glacier and invited the Ice people. He went again to see if they were coming, and saw much down and feathers stretching in a straight line across the water from the glacier to his own house. He thought, "They will come by this route in the morning." </p>
<p>Early next day they came out of the glacier, and embarked in their canoes. They arrived, and ate until they were full. Then they thanked the man, saying, "We are poor, lowly people, and you invited us to the feast. Thank you!" He answered, "I asked every one to the feast, but no one responded. Then I tried you, and I am glad you came. You have eaten now. My heart is at ease now regarding my deceased friends. I shall sleep well to-night. Thank you!" </p>
<p>Before this, feasts for the dead were unknown. This was the first one. The Ice people now said, "Henceforth people must do this always. When a relative dies, they must make a feast for the other people to eat, and also burn some food in the fire, so that the dead people may also eat." People have since done this until the present time. </p>
