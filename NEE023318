<pb n="58"/>Bas asal [original bas] were also made by Tohan, but by mistake. When Tohan told Nabi to fashion people out of earth, Nabi made two figures. He went to Tohan for breath (njug). Tohan placed breath in Nabi's clenched fist, but he carried it incorrectly. That is to say, he wanted to have a look at breath. But breath escaped, and there was nothing in Nabi's fist for him to see. So Nabi returned to Tohan and told him that breath had not reached at the two figures. "Oh, they have become bas then!" exclaimed Tohan. And he was right. The two figures turned into bas. They had different eyes, and they want to eat our (true human's) ruwai. When they look upon a ruwai they see meat. So Nabi made two more figures and when Tohan gave him breath to carry in his fist, he did so correctly and the figures became true human beings. But if Nabi had not wanted to look at breath there would have been no bas.
