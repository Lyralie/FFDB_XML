Six little foxes there were. When there were six little foxes, I was the smallest and most wretched little fox [of them all]. Both day and night I was wretched[-ly ailing], <pb n="179"/>I lay by the fire. From above the ashes flew on to me: it was so. 
One year, when we listened, we overheard that a rich man of Turupa was going to visit Matomai. Having heard, my elder brothers talked together thus: they said that when the man of Rurupa would not be [here], then in his absence they would seize the soul of his wife by any means whatever. 
Having heard. I thought: "This man of Rurupa makes 'inaus' [which] all the gods accept, and the land becomes beautiful: me too he refreshes. So - thought I - if in his absence they shall do so, when the man of Rurupa returns, he will be grieved". I sat [so] thinking; one day, when the day was ending, they went out to take [her] soul. 
Having perceived, I rose, and went out of doors. Having gone out, my brothers went running through a wood along a riverbank; I spied them. Having seen, I went running through the wood along the riverbank. Going [along], I arrived first at the house of the man of Rurupa. Having entered, <pb n="180"/>I sat in the place of the master of the house, having made myself into the likeness of the master. 
I said to the mistress of the house: "Now we, being six little foxes, brother foxes, live [together]; I indeed am the youngest little fox. Now my brothers intending to do [this] come now; [as] they have spoken to seize thy soul, having heard, and being sorry [for it], now I, that I may help, have come first [to thee]. 
So, if now the [fox] people come in, what thou givest them first [to eat], if thou givest [it, let it be] hard roe with edible sea-weed; if thou feedest [therewith] the people [that come in], if they be foxes, as I have said, then according [to their eating] thou wilt know [them]". Thus having spoken, I sat. Meantime at last the [fox] people's [coming] along the house, the noise of the people's coming was audible. Through the door five wealthy men came, one after another. 
Along the back wall were the five wealthy men squatting down. I indeed had the appearance of the wealthy Turupan, <pb n="181"/>and imitated his bearing; [and] at the end of my place was the mistress of the house. The wealthy men. having looked at each other, made salutations. When they had done, the mistress of the house [rose]; rising, she prepared some hard roe with edible seaweed. Having prepared [it], she helped the wealthy men, and gave [them] to eat. 
I too ate. When I ate. I had at my girdle the knife of the man of Rurupa. This knife which I had at my girdle did I draw. I sharpened a bit of wood; having sharpened [it], I picked my teeth. Sometimes, as I would look towards the wealthy men squatting against the back wall, [I saw that] they sat lifting up their hind legs. Having seen, I was fain to laugh in my soul, but I did not. After [that], I remained seated. 
As we sat, it became dusk at last. When it was dusk, I lay down on the bedding of the man of Rurupa. The woman placed herself by my side. Afterwards, they fell asleep <pb n="182"/>in the night. I indeed was sleepless. As I listened, there was a sound of the sleeping of these wealthy men. 
Then rising. I took a piece of the hard-baked ashes in the fireplace, and having placed [it] between the breasts of the man of Rurupa's wife, I went to bed. Having gone to bed, I pretended to be asleep, and remained [so]. Now there was a noise of the wealthy men quietly waking each other. When this noise of one waking each other was [heard], then there was the voice [of them] crying, [that they should] take away [her] soul. They would have the eldest fox take away [her] soul. 
The eldest fox, having gone, took the soul of the wife of the wealthy man of Rurupa. The [fox] people, having taken [her] soul, - these people, holding [her] soul, [from] within the house went out of doors. Having seen, I rose, and having risen, went upon their tracks. Likewise my elder brothers went up by the way they had come. I indeed, having run through the forest in the river valley, went up [too]. 
To my house came I first. Entering the house [and] pretending by my bearing to have been nowhere, I continually <pb n="183"/>feigned myself wretched[-ly ailing]. Now the noise of my elder brothers' coming was [heard]. The people entered through the door, holding [the woman's] soul. Round the seats, the people holding [her] soul showed [her] soul one to another. As they were looking, the bit of hard baked ashes [went to pieces], falling through the elder brother's fingers. 
When I saw, then I was fain to laugh in my soul ... The people now saw the soul, ... and [lo, there] were [but] hard baked ashes! The people, seeing, were angry, because the woman of Rurupa was stronger than they in magical power. So the next night, in order to overcome [her], and to take her soul, the people [determined] to go once more: [so] they talked. I kept on listening.
 The next day [when] they rose, the people talked of what they would do. When evening arrived, the people that were to carry away her soul went out of doors as before. When I saw [that], I [too], as before, went out of doors. On the way [on which] I had gone before, I went running now. <pb n="184"/>As before, I arrived first at the house [of the man] of Turupa. Having entered, [and] likewise taking the appearance of the Turupan man and his bearing, I sat in the seat of the Turupan man. Now there was the noise of my elder brothers' coming. Through the door came the people. Just as before, five wealthy men squatted down, sitting along the back wall. Just as before, the mistress of the house prepared hard roe and edible seaweed, and she gave to eat to the wealthy men. I too ate. 
Afterwards, when it was dark, they went to bed. I lay down on the bedding of the man of Rurupa. The wealthy people all lay down along the back wall. As before, I remained sleepless, listening. Now as I listened, there was the noise of men sleeping deeply. So having risen, having cut off a bit of my eldest brother's ear, I placed it between the breasts of the wealthy Turupan man's wife. 
Having placed [it], I afterwards went to bed. Now there was a noise of people rising. As I listened, there was as before the voice of people crying [that he should] take [her] <pb n="185"/>soul. When the people had said that "the night before, they had made the eldest fox take [the woman's] soul, and he could not", now [therefore] they made my next but eldest brother take [her] soul. Now my next but eldest brother went to take [her] soul. 
As before, being rejoiced that they had taken [her] soul, holding [that] soul, they came to the fire-place. The people went out of doors, one after another, on the tracks of [him that held] the soul. There was a noise of their going by the house. When I heard [it] just as before, I rose, and went after them. Having gone out, just as before, on the way on which I had gone. I went running [back] to the house; I came first to the house. 
Just as before, having assumed a bearing as if I had gone nowhere, I continually pretended to be wretched[-ly ailing]. Now at last my elder brothers arrived. Through the door, bearing the [woman's] soul, the people came on the tracks [of him that held] the soul. Round the seats the people held the soul. When they looked, a bit [of] fur slipped [down] through <pb n="186"/>my next but eldest brother's fingers. The people that held the soul remained [there]. 
Now the people showed the soul [to each other]. When the people saw, [they found] it was an ear [of] theirs. The people were very angry. When they looked at each other, it was [to be seen] that the tip of the ear of the eldest fox had been cut off. The people being angry spoke only about that. "O ho! The woman of Turupa is stronger than they in magical power". The people supposed different [things]. 
"Our youngest brother, a quite wretched little fox. doth he not aid the wife of the wealthy man of Rurupa?" So they said. I however denied [it]. "I, such a poor ailing [creature]! why, I have gone nowhere; wherefore do people speak thus?" Thus said I. Therefore the people spoke thus: 
"Now, though they wanted to take the soul of [this] woman of Rurupa, she was stronger in magical power than they; and they were angry. And to the god of one end of the mountains shall they pray, that he may take up their cause; to the god of the other end of the mountains shall they pray, that he <pb n="187"/>may take up their cause". [Thus] talked they. Having heard, I was sorry for the Rurupan man. 
That man of Turupa gives to all the gods ['inaus'] cut and [made with] shavings [of wood], thus beautifying the land; so, if people do thus [to him], I shall be very sad. Afterwards, the people went out to pray the god of the one end of the mountains, and the god of the other end of the mountains, to take up their cause. When I saw [that], having risen, I went out. Having gone out, to the village of Turupa went I. Having gone, I went to the top of the road where the man of Turupa was [wont to be] hewing wood. 
Having gone, I tore up a stump by the roots, [the stump of] a tree formerly cut down by the man of Turupa. Carrying this stump of formerly hewn wood, I went away. Having gone to the middle of the road where he was [wont to be] hewing wood, I tore up a[nother] stump by the roots, [the stump of] a tree that he had cut down [just] before [he] went <pb n="188"/>to visit Matomai; carrying one old stump, one new stump, carrying two [stumps] I went to the house of the Rurupan man. Having come to that house, I placed the old stump upon a girder [of the roof] close to the back wall, having made [it able to] cry out loud with the usual voice [of man]. 
I placed the new stump on a girder [of the roof] close to the front, having made [it able to] cry out [like one having] imitative insanity. Afterwards I, having scooped out a hole [made to set] an 'inau' in, having enlarged it to a burrow, entering, I remained concealed. As I sat, [I heard] there was a noise as of some one coming from the forest. When [he] stepped on hard ground - iririn-tyrin! when [he] stepped on soft ground, - ichakan-chakan! when [he] stepped on dry twigs, a sound of breaking, - chka-oro-to-to! 
When [he] stepped on green twigs, a sound of slipping, - ma-usura-sane! these sounds [were] like [his] steps. At last [he] came near the house. When I saw [him, it was] a large he-bear [that] was coming. At the same time as he came, I jumped at once with a cry on to the girder close to the back wall; a usual [human] voice [crying loud], united with the voice from the front wall girder, fell near the house upon that he-bear. 
Afterwards. I jumped with a cry on to the girder close to the back wall; the voice of one having imitative insanity, <pb n="189"/>united with the voice coming from the girder close to the back wall, fell upon that he-bear near the house. Afterwards that large he-bear went away angry. Then, just as before, there was a noise as of one walking. As I listened [I heard] there were noises like those that had come before, but greater; [they] came near the house. 
When they came and when I looked, really [there was] an old bear [that] came, similar to the former. He beat [the air] with the wrists [of his paws] and uttered a low long growl; thus doing he went to the house. Just as before, I jumped with a cry on to the girder close to the back wall. A usual [human] voice, [crying loud], united with the voice from the front wall girder, fell near the house upon that he-bear. 
Afterwards, I jumped with a cry on to the girder close to the front wall. The voice of one having imitative insanity, <pb n="190"/>united with the voice coming from the girder close to the back wall, fell upon that he-bear close to the house. Afterwards, that large he-bear went to the forest, angry. Afterwards I sat in the hole of the 'inau', staying behind the house of the man of Rurupa, having made a burrow. 
When I listened, [I heard] the god of one end of the mountains, and the god of the other end of the mountains - two gods - being wroth with my elder brothers, foxes five, broke their bones. Now at last the Turupan man, having visited Matomai, returned. Various [things] - rice, also saké, - various things, a great cargo, did he bring, returning. Now the wife of the man of Rurupa told [him]. 
"When thou wast not [there], in thy absence, six brothers, little foxes, those - vying in magical power - beings of the forest space, to take my soul, came to me many times. However, thanks to the youngest little fox, a wretched[-ly ailing] fox, thou hast come to [find] me alive. After [this], they prayed the god of one end of the mountains, and the god of <pb n="191"/>the other end of the mountains, to take up their cause. However, thanks to the help of the smallest fox. I now remain alive". So [she] told [her] husband. 
The wealthy man of Turupa, having heard, was grateful to me. Being grateful to me, he made me a room [constructed] of 'inaus'. Everywhere he put very fine 'inaus', giving to me. Thanks to that, I have become a new being, a new guardian have I become. When I have looked from above upon the man of Rurupa, [since then that] Rurupan man, whatsoever he has done, has done well. More than any other man, he has become wealthy. From the time when I looked on him from above, in all things whatsoever he hath surpassed [other men].
