<p>At this time salmon were numerous in the sea, but they did not go up the rivers. Raven said he would make salmon go up the streams. He took salmon-roe and flew with it to all the rivers and creeks, and put a salmon-egg in each. Now he said, "The salmon will breed and come back to these places again. These waters will be the same as their mother's milk. The salmon must come back to them every year. The salmon belonging to one river or creek will always return to the same stream, because they were born there."</p>
<p>Raven now instructed the people how to make houses for drying salmon. Some of the people said, "Let us finish the house before we catch any salmon. If we catch salmon now, they will spoil before the houses are ready." They thought of houses like those people lived in. Raven said, "No, the houses we shall build do not take long to put up, - only two or three days." He taught the people how to make salmon-drying houses of poles, like those used by people at the present day. He said, "If drying-houses are made too tight, like dwelling-houses, the salmon will not dry well."<note>See Swanton, BBAE 39 : 89 (Tlingit).</note> Raven taught the people how to catch, cut up, and cure salmon, and said, "Henceforth people shall have plenty of salmon for food. Salmon will be caught chiefly in the rivers and creeks during the periods of the run."</p>
