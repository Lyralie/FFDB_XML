<p><note>Malays frighten their children with stories of how the Batak will come and eat them if they are not behaving themselves. This story is probably derived from the Malays. The Chewong regard Batak as yet another kind of bas, one that looks exactly like human beings, but eats human flesh. They are insistent that once there were many Batak in the jungle, but that none have been sent for a while</note></p>
<p>A long time ago the Batak came to the jungle here. One day a husband went hunting. They had not eaten any meat for a long time. The wife stayed behind at the swidden with her small child. Some Batak came to the swidden. The mother did not know who they were. She told them that she had no meat to give them, but that her husband had gone hunting. The people said they would help her with preparations for the meal. "We will get the firewood," they told her. When they had brought it, she made a fire. "We will bring the water," they then said. When they had brought the water, they killed the woman and put her in a large cooking pot to boil her. They tied the child with rattan to a tree. Then the husband returned from the hunt. He saw his wife being boiled. The Batak told him that it was pig meat that they were cooking, but he could tell it was his wife, and said he did not want any. To eat people would be dirty. He then killed the Batak and freed his son. If the husband had not returned the Batak would have eaten his child as well.</p>
