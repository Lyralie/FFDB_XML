<p>The sun set, and ǀχụé was ǀχụé, and lay upon the ground, and slept, was alone, and lay upon the ground and slept. And the sun rose, and ǀχụé awoke and ... and stood up, and saw the sun, - a little sun, - and was ǁgụì, and was a tree.</p>
<p>And his wife saw the ǁgụì, and went to the ǁgụì, and went to take hold of a ǁgụì fruit, and the ǁgụì vanished; and ǀχụé was a fly. And his wife laid herself upon the earth, and cried about the ǁgụì, and died. And ǀχụé was a fly, and settled upon the grass.<note>And he settled upon the grass, and the grass broke. The naine of the grass is goo.</note> And his wife lay down upon the earth, and cried about the ǁgụì.<note>The ǁgụì is a tree. People eat the ǁgụì, the ǁgụì fruit. People do not put the ǁgụì into a pot, but eat it raw. The ǁgụì has thorns.</note></p>
