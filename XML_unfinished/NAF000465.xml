<p>The Bushmen never go to sleep with the moon in their faces. They never build their huts so that the moon shines in at the door. The reason for that I am now going to tell you. A long, long time ago, a number of Bushmen were encamped <pb n="81"/>near some water, where they had killed game. The water was much. They were there a long time. During the night when all were asleep, the moon came down to have a look at herself in the water. The moon often did this, but she did not like the Bushmen to see her. One of the Bushmen waking up, saw the moon washing herself in the water. The sight was very nice. So the man awoke some of his friends very quietly. They looked and they were pleased. They laughed softly. But while they were looking at the moon in the water, some of their enemies crept up behind, and before they could seize their weapons, killed them all. The enemies shouted much, and they took all the meat. That is the reason why we never sleep with the moon in our faces, lest this should happen over again, and some people say that if you sleep with the moon shining on you, you will wake up with a great pain in the face. This is the way the moon warns us not to sleep. It is the end of the tale.</p>
