<p>Long ago some hunters were coming home from the hunt in the dark; and, as they passed the place now known as Lava Beds, they believed that they heard people talking and singing in a house. There seemed to be an old woman addressing some one else, and saying, "Niaʼma, the house<note>Obscure, possibly to be understood as "the Niaʼma house."</note> is full now. We shall soon have no room. Hurry up!" Then they heard the voices of a great many people singing a strange chant. All the men were afraid and ran away, except one man, who listened until the song was finished, and thus learned it.</p>
<p>That night all the men who had heard the song died, except the man who was not afraid and who had heard the song through. He sang the song, and thus introduced it to the people, who adopted it, and used it afterwards as a death-chant. It is one of four mourning-songs used at the present day.<note>This song was collected from the Tahltan (cf. phonograph record VI H. I &amp; 2).</note> The next morning after the men who heard the song had died, a number of people went back to the place, but found not the slightest trace of people. They knew, therefore, that the men heard the ghosts speaking and singing.</p>
