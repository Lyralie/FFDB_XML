<p>Xatēʼtsᴇn was sitting in his house when his attendant came and said, "Don't sit here in the house, for somebody is coming to the beach here." - "Maybe this is what I am expecting, that will make things right on the beach." Then Xatēʼtsᴇn went out of his house to invite Q!āʼnēqēᵋlakᵘ. Then [Q!āʼnēqēᵋlakᵘ] entered the house of Xatēʼtsᴇn, and he was given dried [salmon to eat. It was dried] meat of the double-headed serpent. Q!āʼnēqēᵋlakᵘ began to eat it, and his body became contorted. Then Xatēʼtsᴇn spoke. "Don't urge our friend here [to eat]." Then Xatēʼtsᴇn and Q!āʼnēqēᵋlakᵘ went out of the house. Xatēʼtsᴇn looked at his salmon-weir. Then Q!āʼnēqēᵋlakᵘ transformed him into stone. Xatēʼtsᴇn became a man again, because he also had supernatural power. [He said,] "Go on, take warning, friend! Now I will also do something to you." Then Xatēʼtsᴇn transformed his friend into stone, but Q!āʼnēqēᵋlakᵘ became a man again.</p>
<p>Then he warned Xatēʼtsᴇn. "Take warning, friend! Now I will try you again." They took hold of each other, and Q!āʼnēqēᵋlakᵘ held Xatēʼtsᴇn by his sides. He lifted him up. Then Xatēʼtsᴇn was transformed into fog. He became a man again. Then Xatēʼtsᴇn spoke. "Go on, take warning, friend! Now I will do something to you also." Then Xatēʼtsᴇn lifted Q!āʼnēqēᵋlakᵘ and threw him upward. Then Q!āʼnēqēᵋlakᵘ also became fog. Q!āʼnēqēᵋlakᵘ became a man again.</p>
<p><pb n="5"/>Then Q!āʼnēqēᵋlakᵘ spoke. "Go on, take warning, friend! Now I will try to lift you from the rock." Then Q!āʼnēqēᵋlakᵘ took hold of Xatēʼtsᴇn and threw him upward. He transformed Xatēʼtsᴇn into a crane, and the crane began to fly. Xatēʼtsᴇn became a man again. Then he also warned Q!āʼnēqēᵋlakᵘ. "Go on, take care, friend!" Then Xatēʼtsᴇn took hold of Q!āʼnēqēᵋlakᵘ and threw him upward. A crane was flying there. Q!āʼnēqēᵋlakᵘ became a man again.</p>
<p>Then Xatēʼtsᴇn spoke. "Oh, indeed, you have supernatural power, friend! Come, let us go to my playground." Then they went aboard his canoe, and they paddled, going to Xatēʼtsᴇn's play-round. They were dressed quite with the same kind of belts; namely, double-headed serpents. Double-headed serpents also were their canoes. Then they arrived at the playground.</p>
<p>Then Xatēʼtsᴇn spoke. "Take care, friend! else you might have a mishap on my playground. Nobody who ever tried to come and play on it has succeeded a single time. This is what makes it slippery, the blood of those who came from time to time to play here." Then Xatēʼtsᴇn spoke. "You go on first, friend!" Thus Q!āʼnēqēᵋlakᵘ was told by his friend. "[No,] you first," said Q!āʼnēqēᵋlakᵘ. "You said that it is your playground." - "Let me go first, friend," said Xatēʼtsᴇn, on his part. Then he [Q!āʼnēqēᵋlakᵘ] clapped on the gunwale of his canoe with his paddle, and Xatēʼtsᴇn ran up. Xatēʼtsᴇn ran straight up. He did not rest on his resting-place halfway up: he just turned round and came down again and jumped into his canoe.</p>
<p>Then Xatēʼtsᴇn spoke. "Now you go, friend!" Thus he said to Q!āʼnēqēᵋlakᵘ. "Take care, fasten your belt well, else it might [drag] behind you!" Then Q!āʼnēqēᵋlakᵘ ran. He had nearly reached the top when he <pb n="7"/>slipped on the rock. His belt came off, and Q!āʼnēqēᵋlakᵘ fell down. He fell into the water and sank. Then Xatēʼtsᴇn went away to Q!āʼnēqēᵋlakᵘ's canoe, and upset it on the water. "Indeed, you have no real supernatural power, friend," thus he said while upsetting Q!āʼnēqēᵋlakᵘ's canoe.</p>
<p>Xatēʼtsᴇn waited in vain for Q!āʼnēqēᵋlakᵘ to show himself, but Q!āʼnēqēᵋlakᵘ just did mischief to Xatēʼtsᴇn's land. Q Q!āʼnēqēᵋlakᵘ transformed into stone a beaver that was sitting by the river. Then Q!āʼnēqēᵋlakᵘ caught sight of the watchman at the salmon-weir of Xatēʼtsᴇn. He transformed into stone him and his pole. Then he also transformed into stone the watchman of Xatēʼtsᴇn. Then Xatēʼtsᴇn was vanquished by Q!āʼnēqēᵋlakᵘ, for Xatēʼtsᴇn did not know what Q!āʼnēqēᵋlakᵘ was doing.</p>
