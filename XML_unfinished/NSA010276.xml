<p>The moon-woman Hánuxa caused the great flood. That was at the time of the great revolution in Yáiaašága. Hánuxa was full of hatred against the people, mostly against the men who had seized the women's kína. It was then that all the people drowned, except for a few who were able to save themselves on five mountaintops where the water did not reach. The great flood had barely subsided when those few survivors came down from the mountaintops to the shore of our channels, and our country became populated again.</p>
