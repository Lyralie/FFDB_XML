<p>The two Bead girls were sent by their mother to marry <persName>Cocoon-Man</persName>'s son. He was wrapped up and put away. He had never been outside, and had never eaten anything.</p>
<p>The Bead sisters came from a place far off in the ocean. They came on the water, brought by the wind, and they always sang the song of the wind. It took just one day for them to reach <persName>Cocoon-Man</persName>'s house. His daughters liked the two girls and gave them food. All the men were out hunting, and the daughters sent the two girls into the sweathouse and told them to sit by <animal>pine-marten</animal>'s bed.</p>
<p>They could not get <persName>Cocoon-Man</persName>'s son, the one their mother had sent them for. <persName>Cocoon-Man</persName> would not listen to it, so they took <animal>pine-marten</animal>, and stayed three days with him. At the end of that time they wanted to go home. <animal>pine-marten</animal> asked all his people for blankets and shells to give his wives to carry home. They started. <persName>Cocoon-Man</persName> made a trail to the west to walk on. He sent his words out west, put his hand out west and east to make a trail, and immediately it was open. <persName>Cocoon-Man</persName> sat on the ground in the centre, and made a rainbow reaching from the place where he sat to the home of the girls.</p>
<p>The company started. <animal>Weasel</animal> went with <animal>pine-marten</animal> up to the top of the rainbow, and the women went under it. While they were travelling, <animal>Weasel</animal> made a flute out of a <plant>reed</plant>, and made sweet music that sounded through the world and was heard by every living being.</p>
<p>The two sisters walked on the lower rainbow, the reflection, and reached home safely. Next year <animal>pine-marten</animal> had children. He made a boy of bead-shells, and from a round shell which he threw into his wife a girl was born. In the spring of the second year, he came back on the same trail that <persName>Cocoon-Man</persName> had made. His children grew very fast. Then he left his boy at home, and sent his girl to her grandmother in the ocean. The boy stayed with <persName>Cocoon-Man</persName>. The third year he had two sons and two daughters.</p>
<p>Now <animal>pine-marten</animal>'s wife took one son and one daughter to her mother <pb n="284"/>in the ocean; and <animal>pine-marten</animal> kept one son and one daughter, and they lived with him at <placeName>Fall River</placeName>.</p>
