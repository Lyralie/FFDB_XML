<p>A man once went hunting. He found a leaf monkey asleep in the top of a tree, He shot at it and it fell, but the man could not find the body anywhere. The next day another man, the first man's brother, went hunting. He saw the same leaf monkey asleep in the tree top, and he shot at it as well. Though the monkey fell, he could find it nowhere. The following day Bongso also went hunting. When he shot at the sleeping monkey, it jumped down to the ground and became a young woman. She and Bongso slept together and became husband and wife. The wife went with Bongso home to his settlement. One day when Bongso was out hunting, his wife deloused herself. Her mother-in-law watched her and said she did it like a monkey. The daughter-in-law ran away when she heard this.</p>
<p>When Bongso returned home he asked, "where is my wife?" His mother said that she had run away after being told that she caught lice like a monkey. When Bongso heard this he followed after his wife. He turned into a leaf monkey and lived with his wife in the tree tops. If one ever shoots a leaf monkey today and it does not fall, then it is not a real monkey, but Bongso.</p>
