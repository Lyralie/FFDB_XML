<p>The ostrich was the king of the animals and they went with the lion. When they were going together they saw many herds of animals. The lion was afraid of the ostrich because of its wings that chased away the animals. The ostrich left the lion behind and ran in front of the game, and said to the lion, "Kill for me for I am toothless." The lion killed the game [but] he was afraid to eat. The ostrich said to the lion, "Cut it [up]." The ostrich ate the kidneys because he had no teeth. The lion ate all the rest of the meat, and they separated. After they had parted the ostrich made a noise, and the lion was afraid. Next day the lion went to the ostrich and found him asleep, and opened his mouth. He laughed when he opened his mouth, and he said, "My chief, you have no teeth."</p>
