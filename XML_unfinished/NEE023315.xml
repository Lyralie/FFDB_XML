<p>A man and his father-in-law were out hunting together. It started to rain so they sat down underneath a huge tanòi tree to wait for the rain to pass. The father-in-law sat right up against the tree, his son-in-law further away. It was raining at the same time as the sun was shining<note>Humans must take great care at such times since it indicates the presence of bas (who otherwise move only at night).</note> (saben tiregen). After a while the rain subsided. The man called to his father-in-law, "It is raining less now." There was no reply. A bit later he called out, "The rain is stopping." As there was still no answer, he walked up to the tanoi tree<note>The tanòi tree is one of the largest trees in the Malay forest, and it is a traditional home for bas. For the man to sit close to a tanòi tree during saben tiregen was therefore to expose himself to extreme danger.</note> to see what his father-in-law was doing. His father-in-law had become a bas. Long hairs were covering his body, and he moved towards his son-in-law wanting to eat his <ref target="g:GEE2143.036">ruwai</ref>. The man ran away as fast as he could.</p>
