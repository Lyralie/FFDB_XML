<p>[Once upon a time there] was a village. There being this village, the men [of the village] are people that have had <pb n="99"/>from olden time an Empty-House-Devil [in their houses]. When the people was away, [he] lived [in their house] making a fire. From the village ... when in spring the masters of the house went away to the place [where they] catch fish, after [that] there came a boat from another village. To that village this boat arrived.</p>
<p>The smoke was rising from the chimney - hole of that empty house. The steersman said: "Let us land and enquire. It is evident [that] the people of the village have now gone to [their] fishing-place; there is a person who is left, because smoke rises from the house". Thus spoke the steersman. Therefore the boat landed, the steersman having landed and stood, holding [in his hand] the cord to moor the boat.</p>
<p>By the side of the stern [one of] the rowers landed, [and] went up [the shore], dressed in a robe of Manchurian cut. Having gone to the house, [he] entered [it]. When [he] opened the door and looked in, there was a very little fire burning upon the hearth. At the same time a noise was [heard]. When [he] looked in, [he saw] a man clad in a poor garment of <pb n="100"/>fish-skins, [his] face was all hair, - his hands were all hair. This ... man, or what? stood at the side of the hearth.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the man, [who] opened the door, said: "Are [you] a man?" This devil said: "Yes [I] am a man", so said [he]. Therefore this man thought so: "that is probably an Empty-House-Devil". This man went out again. Having shut the door [he] ran. Being outside, after [he] went out, there was the noise of a man coming after. Having turned [round] for a moment and having looked, [he saw] that [he] was pursued by Empty-House-Devil.</p>
<p>Therefore being afraid [he] ran. The man cried out [to his] companions; "Empty-House-Devil pursues me! Run away!" so said [and] [he] very swiftly ran. [He] was pursued by this Empty-House-Devil, [who] almost slashed [his] back with a sword [he had], almost touching his back [he] pursued [him]. When the people remaining in the boat had seen, the steersman, <pb n="101"/>having rolled up in a coil the cord to moor the boat, leaped into it.</p>
<p>Those rowers once [or] twice pulled a stroke. The boat went seawards two fathoms length. Empty-House-Devil then came to the beach. This man [who was] fleeing having leaped, fell with hands stretched forwards upon the lading of the boat, near the stern. Empty House-Devil, having leaped after, fell into the water. [He] entered it [and] disappeared. Thereupon the boat setting out went far into the sea across the bay.</p>
<p>Until [they] came to the open sea, the man [who had been] pursued by Empty-House-Devil [kept] calling out: "Empty-House-Devil!" [He] laughed very [much], yet [still] repeated: "Empty-House-Devil! Empty-House-Devil!" so said he. [The other people] admired that very [much].</p>
<p>If a bad man had been [so] near Empty-House-Devil, it could not had ended so well. Such [is] the tradition about Empty-House-Devil. Although it is an old tradition, still it is told also by people who live now.</p>
