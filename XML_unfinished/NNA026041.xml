<p>Raven spent much time on the coast, instructing and teaching arts to the people there. The coast tribes were particularly his people and children. Therefore the Coast Indians have greater knowledge in many ways, and are better provided, than the Tahltan and other interior Indians. They have better houses, have boxes, and better tools, than the interior people. Raven had finished his work on the coast before he came to the interior. He was tired then, after his years of constant labor, and could not do much in the interior. However, he instructed the interior people sufficiently, so that they could get along. This is the reason why the coast country and interior countries are different now, also why the people are different. Their manners, customs, and beliefs are partly the same as on the coast, and partly different. This is because Raven was unable to do things well there.</p>
<p>Of all countries, Raven spent the longest time in the Haida country. He took great pains in teaching the people there. Therefore the Haida are more skillful than any other tribe. They can make all kinds of things even better than the Tlingit and Tsimshian. This is why the Haida are superior to all tribes in canoe-building, house- building, making of totem-poles, and carving.</p>
