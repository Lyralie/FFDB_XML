<p>My younger brother-in-law,</p>
<p>Put my head in the fire.<note>When the "Knorhaan Brandkop" was still a man, his head was thrust into the fire by his brother-in-law, in order to punish him for having surreptitiously married a sister. Since then he is only a bustard.</note></p>
<p>My younger brother-in-law,</p>
<p>My younger brother-in-law,</p>
<p>Put my head in the fire.</p>
<p>When we startle it up, it flies away; it [cries]: "Wára ǁkháŭ, wára ǁkháŭ, wára ǁkháŭ, ǁkháŭ ǁkháŭ, ǁkháŭ, wára ǁkháŭ, wára ǁkháŭ, wára ǁkháŭ, ǁkháŭ, ǁkháŭ ǁkháŭ, ǁkháŭ!" When it stands on the ground, it says: "Ă wá, ă wá, ă wá, ă wá!" when it stands on the ground.</p>
