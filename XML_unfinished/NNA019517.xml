<p>Gāʼsag·ila was a chief who had many carvings. He came from the south. He put them up when he reached the north country. He went to Gwaʼwē in the country of the Naʼk!wax·daᵋxᵘ, and there he staid. There he made a winter-dance, and his son became a cannibal, whose names were Q!āʼsᴇlīdzas, Haᵋmēk·!āʼlag·ilîs, Ts!āʼxôstāla. This son's son was K·!ōʼgwikīlagᴇmēᵋ, whose son was Q!uʼmqwax· âʼlasᴇmêᵋ.</p>
