<p>There were a man and a woman who had a son. The woman was also pregnant with another child. Now the son requested the <animal>elephant</animal> girl in marriage. He married her and went to live with her at her parents' camp. They lived there for awhile, until the <animal>elephant</animal> girl gave birth to a child. She bore a girl-child there at her parents' camp. Then her husband left his wife and child safely with her people and went to visit his own parents. He went to them to ask for gifts for his child and for his wife.</p>
<p>By this time his own mother's stomach had grown very large. She was about to give birth. But she gathered together the gifts her son wanted, and she ground <color>ochre</color> and spread it on him because she was glad of his successful marriage. All the while her second child lay in her stomach. As her son was making ready his things to leave, the second child all by himself popped out from her midriff. He jumped out and said "Here I am, Mother. Now rub my head with <color>ochre</color> too so I can go with my older brother."</p>
<p>Well, the people were very surprised. They said they had never seen such a thing. Then one of them cautioned the others not to talk like that. He said "Obviously this is a sky-thing, a child of <persName>ǁgauwa</persName>. Let's agree that we've never seen such a thing and just do what he says. A normal child doesn't jump out of his mother's stomach and start to speak. Just rub him with <color>ochre</color>, and let him go with his older brother." This is how the people talked about it. So the mother came <pb n="228"/>with more <color>ochre</color> and she rubbed it on the child. Then she asked her older son to bring his wife back with him when he returned, so that they could all see the new granddaughter. He agreed, saying "Yes, I'll bring her back for you to see. My wife gave birth to a child and the child has grown and I will bring them both to visit you."</p>
<p>So he left, and he took with him his new brother. They walked and walked until they came to the camp of the <animal>elephant</animal> girl's parents. They slept a night there. In the morning the two brothers and the <animal>elephant</animal> girl and her baby daughter left to return to the other camp.</p>
<p>As they were walking back to the brothers' people's camp, they came to a place where there was a <animal>termite</animal> hill. Suddenly the younger brother cried, "Ouch! ǀʼnǀʼnǀʼnǀʼn!" The others came up to him. He was crying "Ouch!" and rubbing his foot. Then he said "Yo!" and took off his shoe and threw it away. He cried, "Go and turn yourself into a <animal>vulture</animal>!" He threw away both his shoes. "Turn yourselves into <animal>vultures</animal> that come down on meat." Then he turned to his older brother and said "Run, brother, run after the <animal>vultures</animal> and they will lead you to meat. Why should we remain so hungry?"</p>
<p>So the older brother ran away after the shoes. Then the younger brother said "This <plant>thorn</plant> in my foot is killing me. Wife of my brother, come and take it out for me." The <animal>elephant</animal> girl agreed, and took out her awl. She had an awl stuck into a well-sewn piece of skin, an awl like a great, big needle. She <pb n="229"/>said she would try to take out the <plant>thorn</plant> with it. But the boy said, "First give the awl to me and I'll point out to you where the <plant>thorn</plant> is. Just take it out and give it to me." So the <animal>elephant</animal> girl pulled out the awl and handed it to him. Before she knew what was happening, he had stuck the awl into her and she was dead.</p>
<p>Now the <animal>elephant</animal> girl had already warned her grandmother that something might happen to her. She had said "A thing which jumps out of its mother's stomach ready to accompany its older brother is a thing that I don't understand. I am shocked by it; my mind is unsettled. So you watch well: a little wind will come to you. The little wind will come to you with something in it. It will bring you some droplets of blood. The blood will come to lodge inside your groin. Take that bit of blood and put it into a container. Don't let on what you're doing - just take it and put it into something. Something like a little dish or a little bottle."</p>
<p>Then they all left the camp, and it happened just as the girl said. A little wind came back to her grandmother. The bit of blood came to lodge in her groin. The grandmother saw it and said, "Didn't the child tell me something like this would happen?" She didn't speak aloud, she just said this in her heart. She took the drops of blood and put them in a bottle. <apartmyth>(Did you suppose that events of long ago, the things that <persName>Huwe</persName> and all those people did, were nice?)</apartmyth> Then she sat and thought, and asked herself "Should I go and see what has happened to my granddaughter? No; it has already happened <pb n="230"/>just is she said it would, so he must have killed her already and there's no help for it." She turned it over and over in her mind. Then she went to some of the young men, the girl's older brothers and younger brothers, and said "Hey! Aren't you going to see whether these people have arrived safely at their camp with your sister?"</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the older brother had failed to find meat by following the <animal>vultures</animal>. The younger brother had killed and butchered his brother's wife and was waiting for his brother to return. While he waited he started a fire. When it was burning well he began cutting off and eating bites of the <animal>elephant</animal> girl's fat. He stood by the fire and cut off pieces of fat and ate them. The <animal>elephant</animal> girl's daughter was standing right there watching.</p>
<p>When the older brother came back he said to himself "Yo! Where's my wife? Why is the child standing there all alone? What has happened - why has my brother made such a big fire and why is he cutting and eating fat?" He came up to his brother and said, "What foul thing have you done? Where is my wife? Where does that meat come from?"</p>
<p>The younger brother said, "Oh stop giving me this business about what kind of meat it is; just take a bit and taste it. Why do you look at a piece of meat and start calling it a woman?"</p>
<p>But his brother said "You big-penis ... you've ruined me. How do you think I can go on living? Do you just want to <pb n="231"/>kill me? Did you pop out of my mother's stomach just to kill my wife for me?"</p>
<p>The younger brother said, "Oh, take some meat and shut up and just have a taste of it, will you? It's just plain meat, obviously; not human meat. Just take a taste of it and leave me alone. Won't you just try it and talk later?"</p>
<p>Finally he tried some, and he found that it tasted like plain meat. So they ate together. But then the older brother began to regret what he had done. He asked, "Is it possible that we will go on living after doing a thing like this?"</p>
<p>The younger brother answered "What is there that will kill us? We aren't going to die - I know better. There's nothing in the world that can kill us. Stick with me. I'm the one to stick with." But this didn't make the older brother feel any better about it.</p>
<p>Just then they saw the young men approaching, the ones who were sent by the <animal>elephant</animal> girl's grandmother. They were tracking the two brothers. As they were coming nearer, the younger brother said, "Quick! They're coming. I'll do something for you so that they won't see you."</p>
<p>His brother agreed, "Yes, hide me; I have no other escape. I don't want my wife's brothers to come and kill me."</p>
<p>So the younger brother got up and went to the <animal>termite</animal> hill nearby. He said to it "<animal>Termite</animal> hill, open and let my brother in: a fight is coming. I'll stand alone outside." And the <animal>termite</animal> hill opened. It opened wide, and the older <pb n="232"/>brother went inside. Then the younger brother said "Now close your door." Click! The <animal>termite</animal> hill came together again.</p>
<p>The younger brother stood outside and watched the brothers of the <animal>elephant</animal> girl as they came closer. As he watched he cut and ate pieces of her fat. When they came up they said "Without a doubt this person standing here is eating our sister. There's her child, right over there." They came right up to the <animal>termite</animal> hill. Quickly the younger brother turned himself into that <animal>bird</animal> the Narons call ǁʼumhaya.<note>The soft call of this bird, like the name of this bird, begins with a nasal click which is different from any of the other clicks. Apparently the sound is an imitation of the call of the bird. I am using ǁʼum to symbolize it. [...]</note> The young men tried to spear it. "ǁʼum!" The <animal>bird</animal> perched on the points of the spears, so they couldn't spear it. "ǁʼum!" It perched on their heads. "ǁʼum!" It perched on their noses. They stabbed at it and missed. Again they stabbed and missed. Again they stabbed and missed, but the <animal>bird</animal> eluded them. "ǁʼum, ǁʼum, ǁʼum, ..." They thought they could spear it, but they stabbed and missed over and over again. Finally they stopped, completely baffled. They said, "Where will we see this person's face clearly, so we can kill him? We can't kill him, so let's go. He has defeated us."</p>
<p>They left him and went off. Then the older brother came out of the <animal>termite</animal> hill. He and the younger brother packed <pb n="234"/>up all the meat and took the child and went home. When they got there, their mother said "Yo! What have you done to your wife?"</p>
<p>The younger brother answered innocently "Wife? What wife? This is some meat I cooked, and we two have been walking along with our stomachs full of it."</p>
<p>His mother said "Don't talk that way about your brother's wife, Yo!"</p>
<p>But he persisted. "This is just meat that I'm holding. How could it be a person? Besides, here's the child you wanted to see - we've brought her to you. Here, take her."</p>
<p>The mother refused, saying "No. I know that you two have done something really bad. Tell the child to go back to her people. I am in pain about what you have done."</p>
<p>When they had finished talking, the child went back to her mother's people and stayed there. Meanwhile the bit of blood was growing. It grew and grew until it was too big for the bottle. Then the grandmother took it out and put it in a skin bag. It grew again and burst the bag, so the grandmother put it into something bigger. Then it grew some more and broke that. Only the grandmother knew about it. No one else knew that she had the <animal>elephant</animal> girl and was restoring her to life. She kept it a secret. She had the bit of blood and it grew and she fixed it, and it grew some more and she fixed it. When it had grown completely it was a woman again! She looked just like she had before.</p>
<p><pb n="235"/>One morning when the camp awoke, the women decided to go gathering <plant>nǀn</plant>. They got up and went off picking <plant>nǀn</plant>. The <animal>elephant</animal> girl's little daughter went with them, saying "Today I'll accompany my aunts and eat <plant>nǀn</plant>." The old grandmother said, "Go ahead, go with them." So the <animal>elephant</animal> girl's mother and all the other women went gathering. The old woman stayed home alone. She spent the day quietly. In the afternoon she took a skin and spread it in the shade, spread it in the late afternoon shadows. Then she took out the <animal>elephant</animal> girl and sat her upon the skin. She ground <color>ochre</color> and spread it on the young woman's face. She replaced her old rags with soft, new skin clothing and hung her all over with ornaments. Then the old woman tied copper rings in her granddaughter's hair the way people used to tie them long ago. She fixed her up so that she was the beautiful <animal>elephant</animal> girl again.</p>
<p>Later the women came back from gathering. Towards sunset they returned. The old woman was telling funny stories and the <animal>elephant</animal> girl was laughing, "ǀeh-ǀeh-ǀeh-ǀeh-o!" As they came near the village, her little daughter said to the others, "Who's that laughing just like my mother in the village?"</p>
<p>Her aunt said, "How can you be so crazy? My older sister died a long time ago. Don't go saying you hear her laughing someplace."</p>
<p>Another woman said "My aunt is certainly dead: this child is crazy."</p>
<p>So they came closer, listening. The <animal>elephant</animal> girl laughed <pb n="236"/>again. This time they said "Can it be? Whose laughter is this? When we left there was nobody but the old woman in the camp; we had all gone gathering. What young girl can that be whose laughter sounds just like our sister's?" When they came into the camp they saw the <animal>elephant</animal> girl sitting there with her grandmother. Her daughter cried "Mother, mother, mother!" and ran to her, flopped down, and began to nurse. When her mother had died she was still nursing, so she flopped down and began to nurse. The others cried out and said, "Yo! Who has accomplished this?"</p>
<p>The young woman answered softly, "Granny, of course. Granny lifted me up. Granny spoke the word and I sat up and was alive. If it had been up to you others alone, I wouldn't be here. Long ago Granny took me and sheltered me in a skin pouch and now I am alive again. That's how it was. The old people give you life."</p>
<p>Then one day the ones who had killed her, the two brothers, came to the camp. They saw her and were very much afraid. They decided to take her back again. Then her people began to question them about the murder. But the old woman stopped them. "No," she said, "don't talk like that. I'll just give her back to them. Just get up and let her get ready. She'll fix them herself." She got up and began to prepare her granddaughter's departure.</p>
<p>The people said to the brothers then, "Here's your wife; you shall certainly take her with you." They talked together <pb n="237"/>and the <animal>elephant</animal> girl's people agreed that she should go away again with her husband. That night the husband and wife slept together. In the morning he said to her "Now we're going to go home to my camp."</p>
<p>The <animal>elephant</animal> girl said to her people, "This man says he's going to take me away with him."</p>
<p>Her people replied, "Yes. You will go with your husband. What can be wrong with that?"</p>
<p>The old grandmother took out a ǂu and gave it to her granddaughter. <apartmyth>(Even long ago the zũǀwasi had this thing, a <animal>gemsbok</animal> horn to blow upon just like the one old ǀukxa uses today. When you blow on it, it goes "odi, odi, chodi" - that is how it sounds.)</apartmyth> She gave the horn to the <animal>elephant</animal> girl, and said, "Take this. Conceal it well. And leave with them. When you have walked and walked and are close to the camp, tell them to enter the camp ahead of you. Say that you are going into the <plant>bushes</plant> for a moment. Say that you have to go into the <plant>bushes</plant> and will come in after them, that they should go ahead. When they have entered the village you blow the horn, so that everyone in the camp falls dead. Then you can return to us."</p>
<p>The <animal>elephant</animal> girl packed up her things and her grandmother helped her. The old woman fixed her up and got her things ready. "The child will stay with us but you will go," she said. The brothers agreed, and so they left.</p>
<p>As they were walking to the other camp, the <animal>elephant</animal> girl kept asking them how far it was to the next hill. Sometimes <pb n="238"/>they would be traveling along a valley of soft sand and sometimes they came to a hill. They would answer her, and tell her how far it was. She said "Tell me how the hills lie, tell me how far it is between them. And when we get near the hill near your camp, let me know. I want to stop before we come into the camp."</p>
<p>They continued to walk. She asked them again about the hills that lay between them and the village. They said, "Here is one hill. Beyond it lies a valley of soft sand and then another hill and then another valley. Then there's another hill, another valley, and then comes a hill that lies <color>green</color>. Near the <color>green</color> hill is our camp. You'll see houses, and children running about with clean tummies and playing. That's our camp. "</p>
<p>She said "all right," and remembered what they had said. They came to a hill and she asked, "Is this it?"</p>
<p>"No, it's still far ahead," they said.</p>
<p>"All right, then we'll keep going," she answered.</p>
<p>A while later she said, "Is it this one?"</p>
<p>"No," they said, "that's the wrong hill."</p>
<p>They walked and walked and when they got to the <color>green</color> hill she asked, "This one?"</p>
<p>"This is the hill next to our village," they answered.</p>
<p>She looked, and there were children standing about in the camp with clean tummies. "Yo," she said, "now you two go on in. I'm going to powder myself and then come into the camp."</p>
<p><pb n="239"/>The brothers went into the camp ahead of her. The <animal>elephant</animal> girl took out the horn and blew it. She blew down the brothers and blew down their people, and the camps of their people were simply flattened. She flattened them all and left them lying there just as her grandmother had told her.</p>
