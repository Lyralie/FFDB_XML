<p>In early times dogs used to talk. When a hunter went home, his dog would run ahead and tell the people that he had killed game. When the hunter arrived, the people learned that he had killed nothing. When hunters killed game, the dogs always said they had killed nothing. Thus they lied all the time. Once upon a time some people could find no game, and were starving. One of the men who had dog went out hunting. He travelled all day, but could find no game. On his way home the dog ran ahead and told the people his master had killed some very fat game. The people were delighted, and made ready to cook some of it. When the hunter arrived, they learned that he had killed nothing. The people were disappointed. The man went out and stuffed excrement in the dog's mouth, saying, "Henceforth you shall not be able to lie. You will be unable to speak." This is how dogs lost the power of speaking like people.</p>
