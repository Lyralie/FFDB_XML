<p>Bald-Headed Eagle was a cannibal who hunted people. He kept them in a house, and fattened them to eat them. He killed the people with an iron knife. Once upon a time he lost this knife, and mourned for it as one does for a dead relative. He sang his mourning-song every day. One day he noticed what looked like a tree with branches floating on the lake and coming towards him. When it came very close, he noticed it was of iron and that all its branches were knives. It spoke to him, saying, "Now you may have many knives; but, before you can have this gift, you must stop killing people." Eagle promised never to kill any more people. The Tree said, "Henceforth Bald-Headed Eagle shall eat fish only. He shall never again eat people." Now Eagle had plenty of iron and many good knives. Some informants say that he was the first to have iron.</p>
