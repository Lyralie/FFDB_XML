<p>[There] was the village of Kotankeś. In the night the people went out [of the house and] from the other side of the river Kotankeś [there] was [seen] upon the mountain a luminous thing like a fire. The people slept, the next day the people rose, again the darkness [came], again the rich man of Kotankeś went out, again he looked [forth], again a thing like a fire was [seen].</p>
<p>Now [he] entered [his] house [and] asked [his] wife for a woman's loin-cloth. The woman took out a loin-cloth and gave [it] to [her] husband; [he] made himself an eye-shade [of it]. Afterwards [he] went away. [He] crossed the Kotankeś river, [came] to the other side [of it], ascended the mountain, and ascended near [that luminous thing].</p>
<p><pb n="97"/>The spirit [thereof was] mighty; when he saw, [it had] the form of a luminary. [He] took [it] quickly [and] brought [it] home. [It was] night, nevertheless [it] was like the day. [He] bore [it] into the house. At that moment [he] put [it] carefully [into a box]; having put [it in after some time he] took [it] out. When [he] looked upon [it there], were within [it]: one [luminary] like the moon in the last quarter; another, like the sun, another like the new moon.</p>
<p>[People] name these: 'the metal images of the luminaries'; behold the things sent down by the gods. At present, all these talismans have definitively lost [their] might. Now they are in the village of Kotankeś in [the house of] Śitorikajnu. The people relate thus the tradition about those things, sent down by the gods.</p>
