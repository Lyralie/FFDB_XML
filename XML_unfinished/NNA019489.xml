<p>Q!āʼnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ started and saw Ōʼᵋmāł. Then Ōʼᵋmāł pointed at Q!āʼnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ. Then he pointed at the forehead of Q!āʼnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ, and there was a hole in the forehead of Q!āʼnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ. Then he took revenge, and pointed from a long ways off. Truly, they were supernatural beings. Q!āʼnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ and Ōʼᵋmāł were equal.</p>
