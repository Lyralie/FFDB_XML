<p>A long time ago an old woman was deserted by her people, who were short of food, and had to leave to look for game. As she was too weak to keep up with them, they left her behind in the old camp, with a fire. After the people had gone, she hunted around and found some scraps of sinew, with which she made a string for a rabbit-snare. Many rabbits came to the deserted camp, as they love to do, and she caught some with her snare. She made many snares of the rabbit-sinews. She caught many rabbits, and had plenty of food. She also made rabbit-skin robes to wear and to sleep in. The people did not find much game where they had gone. After some time they sent two girls back to see if the old woman was alive and if there were signs <pb n="233"/>of game near the old camp. They found the old woman with plenty of food, and well clad. They returned and told the people, who now moved back. As they approached, the old woman went out to meet them dressed in a large rabbit-skin robe, and danced, and sang, -</p>
