<p>The <animal>lion</animal> and <animal>jackal</animal> went one day to lie in wait for <animal>elands</animal>. The <animal>lion</animal> shot with the bow he missed his <animal>buck</animal>, the <animal>jackal</animal> shot with the bow and hit, and he called out, <pb n="75"/>"Ha! ha!" The <animal>lion</animal> said, "No, you have hit nothing, I have hit [myself]." The <animal>jackal</animal> replied, "Yes, father, you have hit." They both went home [in order] to return when the <animal>eland</animal> was dead to cut up the body. Nevertheless, the <animal>jackal</animal> returned to the carcase of the <animal>eland</animal>, and the <animal>jackal</animal> hid the <animal>eland</animal>, so that the <animal>lion</animal> was quite beaten.</p>
