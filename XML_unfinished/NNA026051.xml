<p>Once Raven called all the animals together, and asked them which would be Bear. Tree-Squirrel said, "Let me be Bear!" Raven answered, "No, you will not do to be Bear. You would not make a good bear." Because Raven refused his request, Squirrel began to cry, and this is why squirrels cry as they do at the present day. A man who could conceal himself well in the winter-time was chosen to be Bear.</p>
