<p>The person who first found fire was a woman. A woman discovered fire, a woman was first to see it, <apartmyth>that's what I, your grandmother, am always telling you. Well,</apartmyth> this woman had children and they all ate together around the fire. But her husband slept in the <color>dark</color>. The rest of them cooked their food and ate it. And he ate raw things.</p>
<p>But once the man caught his wife making a fire, and he was very surprised. When she had the fire started, he came and stole it. He stole it and went off and started a fire of his own. He started his own fire.</p>
<p><epimyth>Women had fire first, because a woman is just naturally a great thing! Yes, my daughter, that's how it was, that's how people who have fire have become many and have used fire to cook with. Yes, that's how it was.</epimyth></p>
