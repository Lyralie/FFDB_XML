<p>Once upon a time, as the people say, the jackal persuaded the hare to go with him to be servants to a man, who lived far away. The jackal was hungry, and he wanted to deceive the hare. This man was a hunter, and not long before this, not long before they went to be his servants, he had killed a big buck. He had all the fat of the buck in his house. Now the jackal wanted to steal that fat, but he wanted the man to blame the hare for the theft. So one night, when everyone was asleep, he got up, and ate all the fat. When he had quite finished that fat, he took some of it and he smeared it upon the hare's face, and her fore feet. Then he lay down again. Next morning the man, when he awoke, he missed his fat. Knowing what the jackal's life was, he immediately accused him of being the thief. The jackal at once said, "Not I, look at the hare's mouth, look at her fore feet, and you will see who is the thief." The man was so very angry that he cut a big stick out of the bush, and he caught the hare by the ear. He thrashed the hare so much that she died; but she died saying that she had never eaten any of the man's fat, and that the jackal was a liar. This is the end of the tale.</p>
