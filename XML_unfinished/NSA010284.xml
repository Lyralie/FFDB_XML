<p>One day, upon feeling great desire, the younger Yo√°lox tried in every way to satisfy himself. With this intention he fashioned a human body. In it he first opened eye sockets and inserted his large penis, but he was not satisfied. Then he opened two holes under the nose but he felt no enjoyment here, either. Then he made the ear openings on both sides, but also in these places he found no satisfaction. Now he opened a wide mouth; however, he felt no satisfaction here, either. He continued trying to satisfy his lust, namely in the armpits, at the breasts and the navel, but nowhere did he find pleasure. Finally he made an opening between the legs; here he finally found full satisfaction.</p>
<p>Later, he instructed the men in this. Since then they, too, know how to satisfy their desire.</p>
