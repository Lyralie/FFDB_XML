<p>A jackal and a hyæna went and worked for a man as his servants. In the middle of the night the jackal arose and rubbed the hyæna's tail with fat, and then <pb n="78"/>he ate up all the fat that was in the [man's] house. In the morning the man missed his fat, and immediately accused the jackal of having eaten it. "If you look at the hyæna's tail," said the jackal, "you will behold the thief." Then the man looked at the hyæna's tail, and he thrashed so much that he almost died. The tale is ended.</p>
