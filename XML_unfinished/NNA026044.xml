<p>Raven thought very hard, and tried many ways of making conditions such that people would always have plenty to eat without needing to work. He failed, however, to devise any method by which this could be effected. Had he succeeded, things would have been easy for people in the world to-day; but, because he failed, people have to work hard to obtain their food. Sometimes, even when working hard, they manage to live merely from hand to mouth, and some of them at times have no food at all. Even Raven himself did not always have food, and therefore people sometimes starve at the present day.<note>See p. 221.</note></p>
