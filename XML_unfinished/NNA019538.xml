<p>Xwāʼxwas was the ancestor of the G·īʼg·ilgam. When the Deluge came, he assumed the form of a salmon and went into the lake at the foot of the mountain Xaʼwolē, at the upper part of Nimkish Lake. When the Deluge subsided, he landed at Flat Place [Ōdzâʼᵋlîs]. There he lived all by himself. After some time, Kunōʼᵋsila came down in the form of the thunder-bird and joined him. Xwāʼxwas built a house. He prepared the posts and put them up, and then he made the beams, but he did not know how to raise them. Kunōʼᵋsila took them up in his talons and placed them on top of the beams. The name of Xwāʼxwas's house was Only-House-on-Prairie [ᵋnᴇʼmsgᴇmdzâʼᵋlas]. In front of his house is a rock which was called Thunder-Bird Place [Kuʼnᵋwas]. This is the place where Kunōʼᵋsila used to have his salmon-trap, and where he caught birds in snares.</p>
<p>After some time Xwāʼxwas became sick. He had a sore [aʼmtaᵋ], which increased in size, and which could <pb n="472"/>not be cured. Finally he died. This disease was inherited in his family, so that it finally became their crest. All the members of his family are liable to die of the same disease.</p>
