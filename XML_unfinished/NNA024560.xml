<p>The Cedar used to be dangerous. When it was broken, it snapped and whistled, and shot off splinters. The mother of two Fawns had been killed by it. The Rabbit came to the two Fawns, and he told them to make a fire to cook for him. They told him that they could not do so; the Cedar had killed their mother and was dangerous. Nevertheless, he ordered them to make a fire. Because they feared him, they went, but unwillingly. When they broke the wood, it snapped, and shot, and flew about. The Fawns were frightened, and ran about, dodging the wood, and crying like animals. Pieces flew about the Rabbit also, and he became angry. He took a rock and smashed the Cedar Tree as if it had been struck by lightning. He <pb n=277>said to it, "You have done wrong. You will be called Cedar. You will do no more harm. You used to kill people, but you will do so no more."</p>
