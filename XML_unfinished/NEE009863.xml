<p>An old woman lived with her grandson, a young orphan. One day the lad walked along the shore, gathering edible seaweed. He sang, "I am walking along the shore, gathering seaweed. I will put it into the fold of my shirt, and I will carry it home." He gathered a heavy load of it and carried it home. Then he entered into the outer house, and called to the old woman, "Halloo!" - "Ho!" - "How shall I bring it into the sleeping-room?" The sleeping-room was ever so small. "I do not know. Come in as through the eye of a needle!" - "Which needle's eye?" - "This one." She thrust a needle out of the sleeping-room, and he passed through along with his load. <epimyth>So skilful are the people of Uñiʼsak. That is all.</epimyth></p>
