<p>Once there was a man who killed a large snake. He brought it home and cooked it. There was a lot of good fat and the man, his wife, and the other people present ate it. It tasted very good. His son-in-law would not eat it and he told his wife not to do so. Nobody knew about <ref target="g:GEE2143.041">talaiden</ref> in those days. When they had eaten, a strong wind blew up. It blew along the ground, and water began to well up from the earth<note>One way the Chewong have of telling whether a particular storm is a <ref target="g:GEE2143.041">talaiden</ref> storm is to watch out for such a wind which blows along the ground. This is said to be the Snake's breath. Another sign is the upwelling of waler.</note>. Water flooded everywhere and everybody climbed tall trees. After seven days the wind ceased. The people climbed down, all except the couple who had not eaten the snake meat. The houses had fallen down into holes in the ground. The Original Snake was waiting for them, and all the people fell down the holes and were gobbled by the Snake<note>Although the Chewong are frightened of being crushed by a falling tree during a <ref target="g:GEE2143.041">talaiden</ref> storm, the punishment is to be gobbled by the Snake. The children are admonished when caught teasing an animal by, "Don't laugh, the Snake will gobble you."</note>. Only the couple who had not eaten snake meat were safe. Since that day we [the Chewong] have been frightened of eating snake, even though the meat has lots of fat.</p>
