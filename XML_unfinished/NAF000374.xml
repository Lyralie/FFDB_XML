<p><note>The Mason Wasp resembles the Palpares and Libellula. It has a small body. The Mason Wasp flies, and is to be seen in summer near water; ǀhaŋǂkassʼō has seen it in our garden at Mowbray. it is rather smaller than the Palpares and Libellula.</note></p>
<p>The Mason Wasp<note>He was formerly a man; therefore, he had a bow; therefore, he shot his wife, when he had not shot the hare.</note> formerly did thus as he walked along, while [his] wife walked behind him, the wife said: "O my husband! Shoot for me that hare!" And the Mason Wasp laid down his quiver; the Mason Wasp said: "Where is the hare? And [his] wife said: The hare lies there."</p>
<p>And the Mason Wasp took out an arrow; the Mason Wasp in this manner went stooping along.<note>We are accustomed to go along stooping, when we wish that the hare may quietly lie hidden [knowing that people are at hand; lying still, thinking that it will be passed by].</note> And the wife said: "Put down [thy] kaross! Why is it that thou art not willing to put down [thy] kaross?" Therefore, the Mason Wasp, walking along, unloosened the strings of the kaross; he put down the kaross. Therefore the wife said: "Canst thou be like this?<note>She mocked at the man on account of the middle of the man's body, which was slender; hence she mocked at the man.</note> This must have been why thou wert not willing to lay down the kaross."</p>
<p>Therefore, the Mason Wasp walked, turning to one side; he aimed at [his] wife, he shot, hitting the [head of] the arrow on [his] wife's breast<note>i.e. breaking her breastbone.</note> [bone]. <pb n="172"/>And [his] wife fell down dead on account of it. Then he exclaimed: "Yī īī hĭhĭ̍! O my wife hĭ!" [crying] as if he had not been the one to shoot [his] wife. He cried, that he should have done thus, have shot his wife; his wife died.</p>
