Raven continued his journey south along the seashore, and came to a river where the Mink people lived. These people were very wealthy, and their women were very pretty. Raven wanted to marry the daughter of a wealthy man or chief among them. He made a very large canoe, and got the birds to man it and act as his servants. He sat down in the middle of the canoe with a large hat on. He wanted the people to believe that he was an important man. He sent one of the birds to ask the wealthy chief for his daughter. He told the bird, "Say <pb n="211"/>that you are my son; and if he askes my name, tell him 'Skin-Bag.'" The chief asked the bird what was the name of his father; and he answered, "Skin-Bag." The chief said, "There is no nobleman of that name known to us. Tell your father that my daughter cannot marry a man of low rank." He asked his daughter if she liked her suitor; and she answered, "No." 
Raven went away, and in a short time returned again in a lager canoe manned by many birds, who pretended they were his slaves. He also had much property in the canoe which he had made, to be given to the chief as presents for his daughter. Raven tried again; but the chief said, "My daughter can marry a nobleman of rank only. Your master cannot tell his rank, and not even his parentage. I do not want his presents, or canoe, or slaves, because he is of low rank and unknown parentage." The girl also said that she did not like him. Raven was persistent, however, and continued to return and ask for the girl. At last the people became tired of him, and drove him away. Raven did not know who his father was, or how he came into the world, perhaps because he left his home when he was so young.
