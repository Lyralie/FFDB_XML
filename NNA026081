Mosquito and Woodworm lived together. The latter saw that Mosquito, when he came home, was swelled up with blood that he had eaten. Woodworm asked him where he obtained it; and he answered, "I get it from the trees. I suck their blood." Woodworm then attacked the trees; and this is the reason why woodworms at the present day bore in wood. They look for blood. If Mosquito had told Woodworm that he sucked blood from the people, Woodworm would attack and kill man at the present day.
