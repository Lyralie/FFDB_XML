He arrived at Gwāʹᵋnālālis. Then Q!āʹnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ pretended to be an old man. He sat down by a water. "Wash, wash, child of Gwāʹᵋnālālis!" [he thought]. Then the children of Gwāʹᵋnālālis came. They were four girls. They saw Q!āʹnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ. Then one of the children of Gwāʹᵋnālālis said, "A nice little one is sitting on the beach. He shall be my slave." Thus said the oldest child of Gwāʹᵋnālālis. She took water and washed herself. Then she called Q!āʹnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ. "Come, wash my back," said the oldest child of Gwāʹᵋnālālis. Then Q!āʹnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ washed the back of the girl. Then Q!āʹnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ took gum and put it on his first-finger. Then he touched with his first-finger the womb of the child of Gwāʹᵋnālālis. He touched three of them from behind with his finger, but he did not want to touch the one. "Why is this one so daring? Do I know where you come from?" - "You will have her for your wife," said Q!āʹnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ [referring] to the youngest child of Gwāʹᵋnālālis . Then he married the child of Gwāʹᵋnālālis.<note>"That means I will have you for my wife," thought Q!āʹnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ in regard to the youngest daughter of Gwāʹᵋnālālis.</note> Then the older sisters of the wife of Q!āʹnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ became pregnant. Then the wife of Q!āʹnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ became pregnant, and she had a child. 
<pb n="197"/>Then Gwāʹᵋnālālis spoke. "Let us go and split boards." Thus said Gwāʹᵋnālālis. Then they paddled. They saw what was to be split. Then Gwāʹᵋnālālis drove in wedges, and the cedar-tree opened. Then the hammer dropped. It fell into the cedar-tree. "Come get our hammer. It dropped in," [said Gwāʹᵋnālālis]. Then Q!āʹnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ took the hammer. Gwāʹᵋnālālis knocked out [the spreading sticks. The tree] clapped together, and blood came out, and Q!āʹnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ was dead. Then he saw the blood of Q!āʹnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ. He took the wedge and put it into the wedge-bag. "Serves you right! You came to make me ashamed." Gwāʹᵋnālālis started, carrying his wedge-bag. Then Q!āʹnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ, came, carrying the hammer. "Why are you going away?" said Q!āʹnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ. Gwāʹᵋnālālis said, "Come, let us go and do our work!" Gwāʹᵋnālālis came and began to drive in his wedges. Then the cedar tree opened. It was spread out. Then the hammer dropped in. "Come get it! My hammer dropped in." Then Q!āʹnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ went into the cedar and got it, and Gwāʹᵋnālālis knocked out the spreading-stick of the cedar tree. It clapped together, and blood came out. "Serves you right! You came to make me ashamed. You did not see what I was going to do to you." Gwâʹ?nâlâlis started. "Don't go away!" said Q!āʹnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ. "I am bringing your hammer." - "Oh, that is good, my dear!" said Gwāʹᵋnālālis. "I thought you were dead." Then they finished their work and paddled home. 
Then Q!āʹnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ threw rotten wood into the water. Q!āʹnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ said to the rotten wood, "You shall become dolphins." Then the rotten wood began to jump and became dolphins. They came and jumped at the head of Gwāʹᵋnālālis. Then his face began to swell. His eyes could not be seen because he was swollen. That was done by the dolphins. Then Q!āʹnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ took salmon <pb n="199"/>berries, and put the berries into a bucket. Then he paddled, going home. He took the salmon-berries and gave them to his mother-in-law [his parent-in-law; namely, his woman parent-in-law] to eat. Then Gwāʹᵋnālālis was hurt. 
Q!āʹnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ lay down in the house. "Why are you downhearted?" said the wife of Q!āʹnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ; and Q!āʹnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ spoke, and said, "The reason that I am downhearted is that Only-One is probably dead." Thus said Q!āʹnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ. Then Gwāʹᵋnālālis spoke. "Go and see him," Gwāʹᵋnālālis said to his child, "only take your chamber-vessel." Thus said Gwāʹᵋnālālis to his child, the wife of Q!āʹnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ. Then he started to see his younger brother. Now Only-One was dead. Then Q!āʹnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ cried on account of his younger brother, when he was dead. The flesh of Only-One was all gone. There were only bones. Then the wife of Q!āʹnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ took her chamber-vessel and sprinkled Only-One. He came to life. "Hë!" said Only-One, "I have been asleep for a long time." Thus said Only-One. "You did not sleep," said Q!āʹnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ to his younger brother Only-One, "you were dead." 
Then Lord Q!āʹnēqīᵋlax̣ᵘ spoke. I am going to start again. I have seen much that is wrong, that I will set right." <epimyth>That is the end.</epimyth>
