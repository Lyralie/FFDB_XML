The Cold-Wind people lived in the far north, and the Warm-Wind people in the south. When the former talked to the latter, a cold wind blew. When the latter talked to the former, a warm wind blew. The speech of the Cold-Wind people was cold because it came from cold place, and the people were as cold as ice. The speech of the Warm-Wind people was warm, because they were hot. The winds were the same as the breaths of these people. Their breaths blow the clouds. Raven [or some one else] ordained that these people send out the winds.
