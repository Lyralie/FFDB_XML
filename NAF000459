A lot of Bushmen were once sleeping, at a vlei. One of them happened to wake [out of his sleep], and saw the moon come down to wash her face in the water. He told the rest, and they were so pleased with the sight that they forgot ,to keep watch, and their enemies crept up behind them and slew them all. The ,tale is ended.
