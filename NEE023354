<pb n="124"/>Once there was a girl whose mother died. Her older sister who was married and lived elsewhere did not want her younger sister to come and live with her. The girl lived alone in the house where her mother had died and under which she had been buried. Her brother-in-law would bring her meat or fish every day. The mother's ghost took her daughter's soul and brought it to Pulao Klam [the afterworld]. This meant that the girl only wanted to sleep<note>According to the Chewong, the ghost (yinlugen) of a newly dead person misses its close relatives, and takes their <ref target="g:GEE2143.036">ruwai</ref> if an opportunity to do so arises. For this reason, the Chewong have an expulsion ceremony of the ghost, and abandon the grave. In this case the correct procedure had not been carried out. The girl should not have continued to live over her mother's grave, but should have moved to her sister's house (See also part III).</note>. She slept all day and all night. She only woke up when her brother-in-law brought the meat. He would call out, "Here is your meat," and she would wake up long enough to cook and eat it and then she went back to sleep again. After a while the brother-in-law ceased bringing her food. One day Bongso came walking by her house. He saw the sleeping girl. Bongso understood what was the matter with the girl. He was <ref target="g:GEE2143.032">putao</ref>. He had been hunting, so he left some of the meat in the house for her. When the girl woke up, she saw the meat and thought that her brother-in-law had left it for her. She cooked it. When it was ready, Bongso returned. She offered him some, saying that her brother-in-law had given it to her. "No," said Bongso "it was I who left it here for you." Then Bongso prepared for a <ref target="g:GEE2143.025">nöpoh</ref> in order to get the girl's <ref target="g:GEE2143.036">ruwai</ref> back. He made <ref target="g:GEE2143.035">riding</ref> and headbands, and asked the girls in the settlement to come and play the drums. The girl's older sister did not want to play drums, but the other girls did. The girl herself was fast asleep and did not know what was going on around her. Bongso bla med<note>Before starting a <ref target="g:GEE2143.025">nöpoh</ref>, or conducting a healing ritual, a <ref target="g:GEE2143.032">putao</ref> blamed, "cuts open (his) eyes." This is in order to see in the other worlds, and it is achieved by stroking the smoke from the <ref target="g:GEE2143.027">òz taba</ref> bowl across the eyes.</note>, and his <ref target="g:GEE2143.036">ruwai</ref> went to Pulao Klam. Here he met the ghost of the girl's mother and he asked her to give him the girl's <ref target="g:GEE2143.036">ruwai</ref> so that he could return it to her body. "She is my fiancée," he told the mother's ghost "and if you don't give up her <ref target="g:GEE2143.036">ruwai</ref> she will die." So the mother gave him her daughter's <ref target="g:GEE2143.036">ruwai</ref> and he brought it back to the girl. Once her <ref target="g:GEE2143.036">ruwai</ref> was back in her body, the girl stopped sleeping and she and Bongso became man and wife.
