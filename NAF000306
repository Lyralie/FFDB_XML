The person who first found fire was a woman. A woman discovered fire, a woman was first to see it, that's what I, your grandmother, am always telling you. Well, this woman had children and they all ate together around the fire. But her husband slept in the dark. The rest of them cooked their food and ate it. And he ate raw things.
But once the man caught his wife making a fire, and he was very surprised. When she had the fire started, he came and stole it. He stole it and went off and started a fire of his own. He started his own fire.
Women had fire first, because a woman is just naturally a great thing! Yes, my daughter, that's how it was, that's how people who have fire have become many and have used fire to cook with. Yes, that's how it was.
