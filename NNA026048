After the great Flood, people were afraid that the earth might tip again, and cause another flood.<note>Compare "The Great Flood," p. 232.</note> The earth was very light in those days, and rolled up and down, displacing the ocean. Water would thus rush to one place and stay for a while. Then the earth would tip, and the water would rush back again. This is said to have happened several times; and some people say that the great Flood that destroyed people came about in this way. Therefore, to make the earth secure and steady, Raven put a large piece of ice on the earth to weigh it down and prevent it from tipping.<note>This ice is said to be in the far north, according to some, and to be great glaciers in high mountains, according to others.</note> Since then the earth has not tipped, and has been steady.
