The Warm and Cold Winds people were enemies. When the Warm-Winds people walked abroad and travelled north, the Cold-Winds people were afraid, and made cold winds blow from the north to drive them back. The farther north the Warm-Winds people came, the more afraid the Cold-Winds people became, and the harder and colder they made the winds blow, sending hail and snow with them. The Warm-Winds people always turned back in fear of freezing. When the Cold-Winds people travelled south, the Warm-Winds people in turn became afraid, and blew their hot breaths on them and urinated on them. Their urine was rain. The Cold-Winds people became afraid of melting, and turned back. Thus we see them striving at the present day, and each is still afraid of the other. When each stays in his own country, as they do sometimes for considerable lengths of time, there is no fighting; and the weather is neither hot nor cold, but temperate. When they near each other's countries, then they become afraid, and send their winds against each other.
