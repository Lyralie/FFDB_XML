The Wind [[The young wind blew, while, the young wind felt that its fathers seemed formerly to have blown; for, they were the wind. Therefore, they blew. For the people did not tell me about the wind's parents - , for, they merely talked to me about the young wind.]] [i.e. the Wind's son] was formerly a man. He became a bird. [[The Wind was formerly a person; he, became a bird. Therefore, he is tied up in stuff. His skin is that which we call stuff.]] And he was flying, while he no longer walked, as he used to do; for, he was flying, and he dwelt, in the mountain [that is, in a mountain hole]. Therefore, he was flying. He was formerly a man. Therefore, he was formerly rolling [a ball]; he was shooting; while he felt that he was a person. He became a bird; and he was flying, and he dwelt in a mountain's hole. And he was coming out of it, he flew about, and, he returned to it. And he came to sleep in it; and, he early awaking goes out of it; [109] he flies away, again, he flies away. And he again returns, while he feels that he has sought food. And he eats, about, about, about, about, he again returns. And he, again, comes to sleep [in] it.
