<pb n="9"/>The stars are the moon 's children. A long time age the sun had children as well. It was very hot on Earth. The sun and the moon were sisters. The sun was the elder sister. One day the moon took all her children and hid them in the knot of hair she wore at the nape of the neck. "Where are all your children?" asked the sun. "I have swallowed them," replied the moon, "why don't you eat yours as well?" So the sun did. When she had swallowed all of them, the moon opened up her hair and let all the stars out. The sun realized that she had been tricked. She was very angry. She quarrelled with the moon who ran away. The sun ran after her, but she could not catch up with the moon. She is still chasing her younger sister across the sky and below the Earth.
